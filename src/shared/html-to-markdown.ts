/**
 * html-to-markdown.ts — turns a fetched page into something worth spending
 * tokens on.
 *
 * In `domain/` because it is a pure function of a string: no environment, no
 * filesystem, no `gh`, no network. It sat in `lib/` for no reason but the
 * accident of having been written next to its one caller -- and the only cost of
 * leaving it there was that the next pure helper would have had a precedent for
 * either directory.
 *
 * Raw HTML is mostly not content. A page that reads as a few hundred words
 * arrives as tens of kilobytes of markup, and every byte of it is resent on
 * each later inference of the run. Converting first is not a nicety; it is the
 * difference between a page costing a paragraph and costing a chapter.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free, and deliberately not a complete converter. The
 * established libraries need a DOM (`jsdom`) or a browser (`playwright`), which
 * would add tens of megabytes and seconds of startup to a runner whose whole
 * MCP surface is currently one package. What a model needs from a page is its
 * prose, its headings and its links, and that survives a careful pass of
 * regular expressions.
 *
 * Where this is wrong, it is wrong in the safe direction: an unrecognised
 * construct loses its formatting, not its text.
