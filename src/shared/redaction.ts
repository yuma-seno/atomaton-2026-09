/**
 * redaction.ts — removes credential-shaped text from what a run emits.
 *
 * Applied where a command's output enters the run, because that output reaches
 * three places and only one of them is protected. GitHub Actions substitutes
 * `***` for registered secrets in the workflow LOG; it does nothing for the issue
 * comment a run posts, or for the session JSON saved to the `atomaton-data` branch.
 * Those two publish whatever they were given.
 *
 * Be clear about what this is not. It cannot catch a value derived from a secret
 * — a slice of a key, a base64 of one — because nothing distinguishes that from
 * ordinary text. It recognises the shapes credentials are issued in, and the
 * exact values this process was handed. A secret that has been transformed gets
 * through, so this is a net under the real controls, not one of them.
 */

/**
 * Credential formats worth recognising by shape.
 *
 * Each is a vendor-issued prefix followed by an opaque body, which is what makes
 * them safe to match: no ordinary sentence looks like one. Formats that are
 * merely long and random are left out, since matching those would redact
 * commit SHAs and test fixtures and teach everyone to distrust the output.
