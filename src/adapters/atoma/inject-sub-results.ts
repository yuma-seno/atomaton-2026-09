 * both were wrong. It was not pure: it called `gatherSubResults`, up to three
 * `gh` calls per sub-issue. And it is not a copy: it mutates `session.messages`
 * in place and returns the same object, which "copy-in-place" says in one
 * self-contradictory breath.
 *
 * The cost was that this rule -- find the last tool message, replace it, append
 * when there is none -- could not be tested without a fake `gh` on PATH. It is a
 * decision about a data structure and now reads like one.
