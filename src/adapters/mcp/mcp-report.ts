/**
 * mcp-report.ts — how a server says that it answered worse than it should have.
 *
 * Not logging. `log()` is for a person reading a run afterwards; this is for the
 * agent that is about to use the answer. atoma attaches what arrives here to that
 * server's next tool result, so it reaches the run that is affected, in the place
 * it is affected — see `engineering/environment` for what the agent
 * then does about it.
 *
 * ## Why not just keep writing WARN to stderr
 *
 * That works today, and it is why the reranker line is caught at all: atoma
 * reads a spawned server's stderr and guesses severity from the words. Guessing is
 * the fallback's defining weakness, and it fails in both directions —
 *
 *   - a report that does not happen to contain `warn` or `error` is never seen
 *   - a line that mentions one of those words while reporting nothing becomes a
 *     warning in front of the agent
 *
 * — neither of which announces itself. `notifications/message` carries the level
 * as a field, so nothing is inferred. It also works over any transport, which
 * matters the moment a server moves to a `url`: a server atoma did not
 * start has no stderr atoma can read, and this becomes the only channel it has.
 *
 * ## What belongs here
 *
 * **What changed about the answer, not that something happened.** A message the
 * agent cannot act on costs it a result it has to read past, and a channel that
 * carries those is a channel that gets ignored — which would take the ones that
 * matter with it.
 *
 * Two questions, either one being yes:
 *
 *   - is the answer worse than it should have been? (the reranker fell back, so
 *     the results are first-stage ordered)
 *   - will the same thing happen on the next call? (the index cannot be saved, so
 *     every search from here rebuilds it)
 *
 * And one that is no on its own: a failure the result already describes. The agent
 * is being told; telling it twice in two shapes is noise. `mergePr`'s
 * `parent_outcome: "close-failed"` and `dispatch_sub_agent`'s error list are both
 * in the result, and both stay `log()`.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * A report made before the server has connected is held and sent once it has. That
 * is not an edge case: that load begins at startup, and the failure this whole
 * mechanism exists for happens before any tool has been called. atoma buffers it
 * from there until the first result, so it still arrives where it is used.
