/**
 * notify.ts — Resolve who to notify (a GitHub login) for a given issue or
 * PR. The one canonical implementation, used directly (no more subprocess
 * spawn) by every caller: mcp/github.ts, concludeIssue,
 * the aggregation gate (lib/aggregation.ts), and
 * src/scripts/resolve_notify.ts's thin CLI wrapper (kept because
 * atomaton-runner.wac.ts invokes it as a workflow step, via `scriptCommand`).
 *
 * # This is the fallback, not the rule
 *
 * Who gets notified is decided where a run starts, and every live path already
 * answers the question this module answers badly. A run started by a comment
 * notifies whoever typed it (`comment.user.login`); a run started by an issue
 * notifies whoever opened it (`sender.login`); a run one agent hands to another
 * carries the same login onward, so a chain notifies whoever began it. That is the
 * rule -- **the person who asked for this run**, not the person who owns the thread.
 *
 * This module exists for when that plumbing delivers nothing: a caller that forgot
 * to pass it, a dispatch path added later, a body whose tag was lost. The runner
 * calls it only when `inputs.notify` arrives empty. Read what follows as recovery,
 * and do not extend it as though it were the policy -- if a new trigger needs a
 * notify, it decides one at the trigger, where it knows who acted.
 *
 * # What recovery does
 *
 * Looks for an `<!-- atomaton:notify=LOGIN -->` tag in the body -- embedded by
 * mcp/github.ts at creation time, carrying the requester the creating run knew.
 *
 * Falls back to the issue/PR's own author when no tag is present and the author is
 * a human. If neither is available, walks up one edge -- GitHub's own sub-issue link
 * for an issue, the `atomaton:parent-issue` tag for a pull request -- and retries on
 * the parent. Measured over all 255 issues in this repository,
 * no issue would need that walk: every one resolves by its own tag or its own
 * author. It is kept for a repository whose history is not this one.
 *
 * Last, the repository owner, so that a failure reaches somebody rather than
 * nobody. That is a weaker claim than the others -- the owner did not ask for this
 * run and may not know what it was -- so the comment that mentions them says why
 * they are being told.
 *
 * Never throws for missing data -- callers treat an empty result as
 * "nobody to notify".
