/**
 * issue-index.ts — keeps the searchable copy of this repository's issues.
 *
 * The index is a cache, not a source of truth: everything in it came from
 * GitHub and can be fetched again. What makes it worth keeping is that
 * rebuilding it from nothing costs one request per hundred issues plus one per
 * hundred comments, and a repository that has been running for a while has
 * thousands of both.
 *
 * Refreshing is cheap because GitHub answers the only question that matters.
 * `?since=<timestamp>` returns just what changed, on both the issue list and
 * the comment list, so an index that is already current costs two requests to
 * confirm. There is no separate refresh workflow, no schedule, and no
 * invalidation logic — the search catches itself up when it is called, or it
 * does nothing.

/**
 * The branch the index lives on, which is its own and holds one commit.
 *
 * It used to be a path on `atomaton-data` beside the sessions, and the two want opposite
 * things. A session is appended to, so git's delta compression works on it, and its
 * old versions are worth keeping -- `/resume` restores one. The index is rewritten
 * whole, its old versions are worth nothing (they are snapshots of a repository with
 * fewer issues in it), and it cannot be lost: with no stored index the search fetches
 * every issue and builds one.
 *
 * Measured on this repository before the split: ten versions of the index, 53.8 MB
 * uncompressed, **4.12 MB packed -- 46% of the whole branch's 9 MB history**, for
 * data nothing would ever read again.
 *
 * So it is written as the only commit on its own branch, force-pushed each time. The
 * history cannot grow, and the force-push cannot disturb a session because no session
 * is on this branch. Two runs racing means the later one wins, which costs nothing:
 * each carries a complete index, and the loser's additions come back on the next
 * refresh through `?since=`.

 * back holding only that one. Storing that as the issue's comments deletes the
 * other four — silently, and a little more on every refresh. So a refresh
 * re-reads the whole conversation of each issue it touches, one request each.
