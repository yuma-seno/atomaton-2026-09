/**
 * Everyone an agent may mention from a thread without notifying a stranger.

 * Three sources, each best-effort and each read separately so a failure of one
 * does not take the others with it:
 *
 *   - whoever opened the issue or pull request
 *   - whoever has commented on it
 *   - the repository's collaborators
 *
 * The `issues` endpoint rather than `gh issue view`, because a pull request is an
 * issue to that endpoint and is not to that command -- one call that works for
 * both beats two that each work for half.
 *
 * An empty result is the fail-closed case and is correct: nothing confirmed means
 * nothing is exempt, and `domain/work/mention.ts` explains why that is the cheaper of
 * the two mistakes.
