  // Three things cannot all be true -- every tool sees the same environment, a
  // credential in one tool is hidden from the shell, and any third-party server
  // works. The container chose the second by giving up the first, and the cost
  // was silent: a write to $HOME inside it succeeded and then was not there for
  // any other tool, in 18 of 2,118 measured shell calls. An agent cannot reason
  // about a write that reports success and does not persist.
  //
  // So: one user for all of them, so no tool's environment differs from another's.
  // Not in sudoers, because with sudo nothing else matters -- `sudo cat
  // /proc/<pid>/environ` reads anything, whatever else is arranged. That single
  // fact is why the flag atoma sets on itself, the PATH narrowing in the servers,
  // and everything else here only mean something for a user without sudo.
  //
  // Three mechanics, each measured on this runner before being written here:
  //
  //   The user. `-M` no home, nologin: it is never logged into, only `sudo -u`'d
  //   into. `-U` gives it a group of its own -- the probe used `-N`, which falls
  //   back to the shared `users` group, and a shared group is a way to inherit
  //   permissions nobody intended. That is the one flag here not measured as
  //   written; every other property was.
  //
  //   Reaching the work tree. It lives under the runner's HOME, which is 750, so
  //   the user cannot get to it by mode alone. An ACL grants `x` -- traverse
  //   without listing -- on each directory down to the workspace, and `rwX` inside
  //   it including as a DEFAULT so files and directories created later inherit it.
  //   Measured: the user creates a file, the runner then edits it IN PLACE, which
  //   is what `filesystem__edit_file` does and what a shared group with umask 002
  //   could not guarantee -- a command can call `umask` and undo that.
  //
  //   A writable cache. $HOME stays read-only to this user, uniformly for every
  //   tool, so a write there fails instead of appearing to work. Package managers
  //   need somewhere real, so the caches are redirected by the environment the
  //   agent step passes.
