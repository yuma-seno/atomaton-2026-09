// Runs whatever config.yaml's `deploy.atoma_runs.targets` says this project deploys.
//
// Same reason as atoma-check: GITHUB_TOKEN cannot write `.github/workflows/**`,
// so a deployment an agent is expected to author has to be configuration. This
// is the fixed shell; the targets, their triggers and their commands are all in
// config.yaml.
//
// Two triggers, for two things GitHub does differently.
//
// A pushed tag arrives as an event, and `on:` takes no expression -- a tag
// pattern that an agent can edit cannot live there. So this listens for every
// tag and `run_deploy.ts` decides whether any target wanted that one. A tag
// nobody asked for exits clean; a red run per unrelated tag would teach people
// to ignore the red.
//
// A merge arrives two ways, and `on: merge` used to mean only one of them.
//
// An agent merges with GITHUB_TOKEN, which fires no `push`, so `dispatchCd`
// starts this run explicitly with `trigger=merge`. It reads the targets before
// dispatching and does not start a run when no target deploys on merge, so that
// path costs nothing when unused.
//
// A person's merge does fire `push`, and nothing was listening -- so a target
// declared `on: merge` deployed after an agent's merge and silently not after a
// person's. `push` on the default branch closes that.
//
// The branch list has to be literal, because `on:` takes no expression and there
// is no way to say "the default branch" there. `main` and `master` cover what
// repositories are actually called, and the job's `if:` then requires the ref to
// be the real default branch -- so a repository whose `main` is not the default
// starts no deployment, and one whose default is neither name uses
// `deploy.your_workflow`.
//
// Schedules are absent on purpose: a cron expression can only be written in
// `on:`, so it cannot come from configuration, and a fixed daily cron that
// checks the time in a script burns 24 runs a day to do nothing.
