 * script-call.ts — Type-safe(r) invocation of the one-shot TS scripts in
 * `src/scripts/` (deployed flat into `.github/scripts/*.ts` by
 * `build-dist.ts`) from inside a workflow step's `run:` bash.
 *
 * NOT `.github/atomaton/tools/scripts/`, which this file used to name. That is a
 * real, different tree -- the MCP servers and the `before_tool` hook, which
 * `build-dist.ts` deploys separately and chmods executable for the agent's own
 * process to spawn. These workflow scripts are invoked by workflow steps and
 * never by the agent. Two trees with two trust stories, and this is the comment
 * a reader consults to find the file.
 *
 * Every call site used to hardcode the *deployed* path as a bare string --
 * `bun run .github/scripts/foo.ts` -- with zero connection to
 * the actual script file, PLUS a separately hand-typed import specifier
 * paired next to it purely so a rename/delete would fail `tsc --noEmit`.
 * Two independent strings, nothing stopping them from silently mismatching.
 *
 * Now every call site imports the script's own `ref` (see
 * `../../scripts/lib/script-ref.ts`) -- a real value, derived from the
 * script's `import.meta.url`, so there is only ONE thing identifying the
 * script (the import itself) and the deployed path is never hand-typed at
 * all. `scriptCommand()`/`scriptCommandWithArgs()` just turn that `ref` (and,
 * for the latter, a typed `args` object checked directly against the
 * script's own `Args` interface) into the `bun run ...` command string.
