/**
 * environment-setup.ts — the one step that makes a project's declared
 * environment exist, for every job that then depends on it.
 *
 * There are three jobs that run a project's own commands: the agent's, the
 * checks, and the deployment. Only the agent's used to run
 * `environment.setup_commands`, so the environment the agent worked in and the
 * environment CI verified in were different machines with different software on
 * them.
 *
 * The consequence was not a broken build, which would at least be legible. It was
 * a build that passes for the agent and fails in CI, and the failure comes back to
 * an engineer who cannot reproduce it. `validate_pull_request.ts` retries up to
 * `CI_RETRY_LIMIT`, so one issue can spend three inferences investigating a
 * failure that exists only on the other machine.
 *
 * The workaround, which this repository was itself using, is to put the setup at
 * the front of a `checks.from_pull_request` entry -- `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
 * before the tests -- and remember to keep it in step with
 * `environment.setup_commands`. Two statements of one fact, either of which can
 * be updated alone.
 *
 * So the step is a function rather than three copies of four lines. A job that
 * runs a project's commands includes it; that is the whole rule.
 *
 * ## What each job reads
 *
 * `ATOMATON_MACHINERY_ROOT` decides, and it differs on purpose:
 *
 *   the agent's run    the default branch. A pull request must not choose how the
 *                      agent reviewing it is set up.
 *   checks             the pull request's OWN config.yaml. That is what lets an
 *                      agent add a dependency and prove the addition works in the
 *                      same pull request, rather than waiting for a merge to find
 *                      out. It grants nothing new: this job already runs
 *                      `checks.from_pull_request` from that same branch.
 *   deployment         the tag or the default branch, both of them post-merge.
 *
 * ## No credentials
 *
 * Setup runs before any secret enters the environment, in every one of the three.
 * That is deliberate in the agent's case -- see the ordering in
 * `atomaton-runner.wac.ts` -- and it falls out of step order in the other two.
