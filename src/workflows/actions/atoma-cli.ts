/**
 * The Atoma release a run installs unless the dispatch says otherwise.
 *
 * Every raise of this pin so far has been coupled to something else in this
 * repository, and the record of what is the reason this comment is long.
 *
 * Moves with `tools/tools.yaml`, not independently. From v0.1.11 atoma removes
 * the credentials it knows about from a tool server's environment unless that
 * server names them, and expands `${NAME}` in an `env:` value against the run's
 * credentials. Before v0.1.11 those values were literal, so a tools file carrying
 * `${GH_TOKEN}` would hand `github` those seven characters as its token --
 * overriding the value it had been inheriting and failing every call with a 401.
 *
 * So the two are one change: raising this pin without the declarations strips a
 * token nothing asks for, and shipping the declarations without raising it passes
 * a literal.
 *
 * v0.1.12 adds the same coupling for `args`: it expands `${NAME}` there, from the
 * environment, which is how a tool server is read from the machinery checkout
 * rather than from the pull request under review. To v0.1.11 an `args` entry
 * carrying `${ATOMA_MACHINERY_ROOT:-.}` is a literal path that does not exist, so
 * this pin and `tools/tools.yaml` move together here too.
 *
 * v0.1.13 is a third coupling, and this one is with the repository's SECRETS.
 * Providers became a table there: `openai` means OpenAI rather than defaulting to
 * OpenRouter, the routers have their own names, and each provider reads its own
 * credential -- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY` -- with no fallback to
 * `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Two credentials present is an error naming both, so a
 * repository that keeps an OpenRouter key under the old name AND adds it under the
 * new one gets a failed run rather than a guess. Raising this pin means the secret
 * has to have been renamed first.
 *
 * v0.1.14 gives each router a name for each dialect it serves, which is what the
 * agent definitions here needed: they read `provider: openai-responses # openrouter`,
 * a row that in v0.1.13 means OpenAI itself. So this pin moves with
 * `agent-definitions/*.md` as well.
 *
 * v0.1.16 carries two fixes that are about THIS repository's runs specifically.
 *
 * The Responses adapter assembled its own `extra_body` merge and left out the
 * reconciliation that protects the runtime tool definitions -- so an agent carrying
 * `extra_body.tools` replaced them. All three definitions here carry OpenRouter's two
 * server tools, and all three use that adapter, so every request sent those two and no
 * MCP schema at all. The model was inferring argument shapes from the names in the
 * system prompt, which is the shape of the argument failures that have been read as model
 * weakness -- `issue_number` for `number`, `form` for `from`, `label` for `labels`.
 *
 * And a `vision: false` agent had pictures replaced before the message entered the
 * session, so what atoma-data recorded was not what happened: resuming with
 * `vision: true` could never get them back.
 *
 * v0.1.17 is a fourth coupling, this one with `tools/tools.yaml` again, and the
 * first where the OLD version is actively wrong rather than merely unaware.
 *
 * It reads `request_timeout_secs` per server. v0.1.16 ignores the key -- serde
 * drops unknown fields -- so the tools file is accepted either way and nothing
 * fails. What the old version does instead is cap every `tools/call` at 60
 * seconds, which is what `shell` and `search` declare that key to escape:
 *
 *   - `shell_execute` offers the agent `timeout_seconds` up to 3600. Under v0.1.16
 *     every value above 60 is a promise that cannot be kept, and a build or a test
 *     suite running over a minute fails with an error naming the shell server
 *     rather than the client that gave up.
 *   - the first search of a run loads a 544MB reranker. Measured at 63.9s against
 *     the 60s cap, so under v0.1.16 the first search of EVERY run fails.
 *
 * v0.1.17 also matches the JSON-RPC id when reading a response. Without that, one
 * timeout desynchronises that server for the rest of the run: the abandoned call's
 * answer stays in the pipe and the next call reads it, so every answer belongs to
 * the previous question and nothing detects it. Which makes lowering this pin back
 * to v0.1.16 worse than it looks -- the timeouts declared in the tools file stop
 * applying at the same moment the mispairing starts.
 *
 * v0.1.18 is why an agent can see a degraded tool at all. A server that reports a
 * problem about itself -- over `notifications/message`, or on stderr, which is
 * what the servers here use today -- has that report attached to its next tool
 * result. Under v0.1.17 the notification was discarded and the stderr line went to
 * the run log, where a person reads it later if at all. `search.ts` logging
 * "WARN could not preload the reranker" is the case that made this necessary: two
 * releases went out with every search answering worse. The instruction that acts on
 * the report is in `prompt-template.md` and `engineering/environment`, so pinning
 * back to v0.1.17 leaves those two telling an agent to read something it will never
 * be shown.
 *
 * v0.1.19 adds MCP's Streamable HTTP transport, which nothing here uses yet: every
 * server in `tools.yaml` is still a child process over stdio. The pin moves anyway
 * because it is what `probe-http-transport.ts` measures, and a repository whose
 * probes and whose runs are on different builds is one where a green probe means
 * less than it looks. What it opens up is a server that is already running -- a
 * shared internal one, or something too expensive to start per run, which is what
 * `search` is at 55 to 64 seconds of reranker.
 * v0.1.21 caps every tool result at 50,000 characters, per server and overridable
 * with `max_output_chars`. It is what lets `filesystem__search_files` off the
 * denylist: what kept it out was that nothing bounded a third-party server, and the
 * bound is now on the client where it covers all of them. Measured before it: one
 * `read_text_file` returned 72,141 characters, a seventh of a 128k window in one
 * message.
 *
 * v0.1.22 removes the default iteration ceiling and adds `--max-runtime-secs`. The
 * pin is not optional here: the runner passes that flag, and an older binary would
 * reject it and fail every run before the agent started. What it replaces is a count
 * of turns, which stopped a run measured at 169 distinct searches and 6 repeats --
 * working, and stopped for being long.
 *
 * v0.1.23 adds `--stop-file`, which is what makes `/stop` a pause rather than a
 * discard: the run ends at a turn boundary with its session written, where killing
 * the job would have left the previous run's session on disk. Pinned rather than
 * optional for the same reason as above — the runner passes the flag, and a binary
 * that does not know it refuses the invocation.
 *
 * v0.1.24 keeps a session whatever ended the run, and answers any tool call left
 * without a result before it writes one. The pin is required by the step below it:
 * saving on failure is only safe because of that repair -- a session carrying an
 * unanswered call is refused by every provider, so an older binary would turn lost
 * work into an issue nothing can run on.
 *
 * v0.1.25 adds three guards on a run that has stopped being work: the same call
 * returning the same answer, a cycle (A,B,A,B) that the old single-slot tracker could
 * not see, and nothing coming back over and over. Each fires on 0-0.3% of the 341
 * stored sessions, which is the point -- they are insurance with no false positives.
 * The pin moves because the guard in `shell_guard.ts` depends on the first of them:
 * its refusal is deterministic, so an agent that ignores it is stopped by the core
 * rather than by a new rule.
