/**
 * base.ts — the typed building blocks every `.wac.ts` file composes workflows
 * from.
 *
 * One theme runs through all of them: in GitHub Actions, everything refers to
 * everything else by a string that nothing checks. `steps.foo.outputs.bar`,
 * `needs.foo.outputs.bar`, `needs: [foo]` — each is a name written twice, in two
 * files, with no error if the two stop agreeing. GitHub resolves an unknown
 * reference to the empty string, so the failure is not a broken workflow but a
 * green one that skipped the work.
 *
 * Each export closes one of those gaps by making the definition the only place
 * the name is written, and every use a TypeScript property:
 *
 *   - `TypedOutputsStep` — a step's own `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` values and `outcome`,
 *     as `.outputs` / `.rawOutputs` / `.outcome` / `.rawOutcome`.
 *   - `DefinedJob` — a job's `outputs:` map doubling as the reference surface,
 *     so `needs.<job>.outputs.<name>` cannot name an output the job lacks.
 *   - `startJob` / `JobChain` — the `needs:` graph derived from the order jobs
 *     are chained in, rather than restated as a list of job-name strings.
 *   - `CustomAction` — a typed `with:` for third-party actions outside the
 *     `@github-actions-workflow-ts/actions` registry. See its own comment for
 *     why it skips that package's semver-tag validation.

 * a separate `readonly outputNames = [...] as const` array (defining what TS
 * exposes as `.outputs.foo`) -- nothing enforced the two matched, so a
 * renamed/removed job output could silently desync from its typed accessor.
 * `DefinedJob` derives `.outputs`/`.rawOutputs` directly from
 * `Object.keys(jobProps.outputs)`, so there is exactly one place that lists
 * a job's outputs.
 *
 * Also accepts `steps` and `needs` directly in the constructor (in place of
 * trailing `.addSteps([...])`/`.needs([...])` calls) purely for readability
 * -- a job's full shape (props + dependencies + steps) is then visible in
 * one expression instead of split across a constructor call and chained
 * methods. `needs` is applied before `steps` (matching the order every
 * hand-written call site used before this class existed) so generated YAML
 * key order -- and therefore diffs -- stay stable.
 *
 * Same `.outputs` (`${{ }}`-wrapped, for `with:`/`env:`/`run:`) vs
 * `.rawOutputs` (bare, for `if:`) split as `TypedOutputsStep`, for the same
 * reason (GitHub Actions `if:` conditions must stay fully bare or fully

/**
 * Express a "producer job -> consumer job -> ..." dependency as an actual

 * reading top to bottom, instead of a named `const producerJob = ...` the
 * caller has to declare purely so it can be passed to the next job AND
 * separately remembered in `addJobs([...])`:
 *
 *   .addJobs(
 *     startJob("parse", { ...outputs: {...} }, [step1, step2])
 *       .then((parseJob) => dispatchToAtomaRunner(parseJob, "inherit"))
 *       .jobs(),
 *   )
 *
 * An EARLIER version of this expressed the same idea as a single function
 * call, `chainJob(name, props, steps, next)`, with `next` as a positional
 * argument -- that reads fine when `next` is a one-liner (as above), but
 * once `next` itself builds a whole multi-line job (see
 * atomaton-sub-issue-closed.wac.ts), it degenerates into a callback buried
 * inside another call's argument list -- nested callback-pyramid style, not
 * an actual chain. `.then(...)` fixes that: it's a real method call that
 * can be stacked one after another, each one visually independent.
 *
 * Each job still exists as a real value (GitHub Actions' own job graph
 * requires a stable reference to appear in both the `jobs:` map and any
 * `needs:`/output read -- no wrapper can remove that indirection, it's
 * inherent to the model, not a styling choice) -- it just lives only inside
 * `.then()`'s callback parameter scope instead of a caller-visible
 * top-level `const`.
 *
 * Only fits a genuinely LINEAR producer -> consumer chain, where each link
 * depends on exactly the one immediately before it. A real multi-hop DAG
 * (e.g. atomaton-pr-merged.wac.ts, where two downstream jobs each need both
 * their immediate predecessor AND its predecessor) still needs actual named
 * handles -- that's an honest reflection of a real graph, not something a
 * linear chain can flatten away.
