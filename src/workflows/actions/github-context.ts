/**
 * github-context.ts — Typed references into the GitHub Actions `github`
 * context's `event` payload (`github.event.*`), backed by the official
 * `@octokit/webhooks-types` package (the same webhook payload schema GitHub
 * itself publishes and maintains).
 *
 * `github.event.*` is populated by GitHub's own servers at workflow-run
 * time -- no TypeScript layer can ever verify the actual runtime VALUE
 * matches what we declare (that would require reaching into GitHub's
 * servers). What this DOES catch: a typo'd or renamed FIELD NAME (e.g.
 * `.mreged` instead of `.merged`, or accessing a field that doesn't exist on
 * the actual payload for this workflow's specific trigger) at authoring
 * time, instead of only discovering it's silently empty/undefined the first
 * time the workflow actually runs.
 *
 * Usage: pick the concrete webhook event type matching the workflow's exact
 * trigger (e.g. `IssuesOpenedEvent` for `on: { issues: { types: ["opened"] } }`)
 * and a selector callback -- the callback never actually runs against real
 * data (a Proxy silently records which properties were accessed and
 * discards everything else), it exists purely so `event.foo.bar` is
 * type-checked against `T`.
 *
 *   githubEvent<IssuesOpenedEvent>((e) => e.issue.number)
 *     // '${{ github.event.issue.number }}'
 *   githubEventRaw<IssuesOpenedEvent>((e) => e.issue.number)
 *     // 'github.event.issue.number' (bare, for `if:`)

 * A condition asserting that the actor behind an event is a repository member,

 *
 * This is the whole trust boundary for event-driven entry points, and it is
 * sufficient because it is the only way an untrusted actor can reach one. Every
 * routing workflow fires on a human action — an agent's own issues, comments,
 * pull requests and merges are made with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub starts no
 * workflow run for events its own token triggers. Agents reach the runner through
 * `workflow_dispatch` instead, which no outside contributor can invoke.
 *
 * So an outside contributor may open issues, comment and raise pull requests
 * freely; none of it starts an agent. A member acts, or nothing happens.
 *
 * Takes an `EventRef` rather than a string, so the association it reads is one the
 * event actually carries. It was a string, and the argument is the whole of what
 * this function is: a caller that passed the wrong path got a condition that was
 * false for everyone, which reads as "no member acted" rather than as a mistake.
 *
 * Returns `Condition<EventRef>` rather than a `JobCondition`, because it is used
 * in both contexts — a job's `if:` and a step's — and the event payload is
 * readable from either. A `JobCondition` would have been narrower than the truth.
 *
 * @example
 *   isRepositoryMember(githubEventRaw<IssuesOpenedEvent>((e) => e.issue.author_association))
