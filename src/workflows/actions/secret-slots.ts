/**
 * secret-slots.ts — the one way a generated workflow carries a credential it
 * cannot name.
 *
 * A step's `env:` is a static YAML map, so a workflow generated upstream can
 * only reference secrets whose names were known when it was generated. Reaching
 * one through a COMPUTED key — `secrets[fromJSON(<names>)[i]]` — moves that
 * decision to run time, and config.yaml becomes where a project says which of
 * its secrets a workflow may see. See `domain/declared-secrets.ts` for what was
 * measured before relying on this.
 *
 * Three workflows need the identical arrangement (atomaton-runner, atomaton-check,
 * atomaton-deploy) and getting it subtly wrong in one is invisible: the credential
 * simply never arrives, and only whatever needed it fails. So the slot `env:`
 * and the bash that renames the slots are built here, from the same constants,
 * rather than written out three times.

/**
 * The step that publishes which secrets this destination may reach.
 *
 * Place it after checkout — it needs a git remote — and before the step whose
 * `env:` uses the slots. Step-level `env:` is evaluated when that step runs, not
 * when the job starts, which is what lets a step output key a secret and is why
 * no separate job is needed.
 *
 * It reads the declaration from the DEFAULT BRANCH, not from the checkout. On a
 * pull request run the checkout is `refs/pull/N/head`, so reading it there would
 * let a pull request decide which of the repository's secrets are handed to the
 * run that reviews it — and `merge.governed_paths` does not cover that, because it
 * blocks the merge and this happens before the merge.
 *
 * Only the declaration is treated this way. The commands a run executes still
 * come from the branch under test, which is the point of testing it. What
 * changes hands is a privilege, and a privilege comes from the branch a person
 * already approved.
 *
 * `$RUNNER_TEMP` rather than the workspace, so the file cannot be one the
 * checkout brought with it.
 *
 * ## Why the fetch writes its own ref instead of using FETCH_HEAD
 *
 * This used to be `git fetch ... || true` followed by
 * `git show "FETCH_HEAD:.github/atomaton/config.yaml"`. `actions/checkout` has
 * already written a FETCH_HEAD for the pull request's own ref by the time this
 * step runs, so a failed fetch did not reach the fall-back: the `git show`
 * succeeded against the pull request's own file, the run took its declaration
 * from the branch under review, and nothing warned because nothing had failed.
 *
 * The `|| true` was there so a fetch failure would not fail the run. It degraded
 * open instead of safely, on the one guarantee this step provides. Fetching into
 * a ref this step owns removes the thing there was to fall back to.
 *
 * The rationale lives here rather than in the emitted shell: an adopter reading
 * the generated workflow needs to know what the line does, not which bug it
 * replaced.
