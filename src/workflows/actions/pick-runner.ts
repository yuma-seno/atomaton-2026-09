/**
 * pick-runner.ts — the small job that reads which machine a project's commands
 * should run on.
 *
 * `runs-on` takes no expression that can read a file, so the value has to already
 * be a job output by the time the real job starts. That is the whole reason this
 * job exists, and it is why it is a job rather than a step.
 *
 * It runs on `ubuntu-latest` unconditionally, and must: it is the job that finds out
 * what the configured runner is, so it cannot itself be on it. It does nothing but
 * read `config.yaml`, so the platform is irrelevant to what it produces.
 *
 * A function rather than two copies, for the reason `environment-setup.ts` gives:
 * two jobs need this and a second copy is a second thing to keep in step.
 *
 * ## Why the checkout, and why the machinery root
 *
 * `config.yaml` has to be read from somewhere. `atomaton-check` reads the pull
 * request's OWN configuration on purpose -- that is what lets an agent change the
 * runner and prove the change in the same pull request, exactly as
 * `environment-setup.ts` argues for `environment.setup_commands`. It grants
 * nothing new: the job already runs that branch's `checks.atomaton_runs.commands`.
