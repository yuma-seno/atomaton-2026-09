// Runs CI against an agent's pull request and decides who works next.
//
// It is a workflow of its own rather than steps at the end of the engineer's
// run, because waiting is the point and the engineer's run is the wrong place to
// wait: it holds the `atoma/in-progress` label and the per-issue concurrency
// group, so several minutes of polling there stalls everything else queued
// behind that issue. This job holds neither.
//
// `workflow_dispatch` is the only trigger, and `create_pr` is what dispatches it.
// It cannot listen for the pull request instead: GitHub starts no workflow run
// for events GITHUB_TOKEN triggers, and an agent's pull request is created with
// GITHUB_TOKEN. Dispatch is the documented exception.
//
// See `scripts/validate_pull_request.ts` for why the check has to be written
// through the Checks API, and what must not be tidied away.
//
// It also checks the deliverable the pull request would merge, before asking CI to
// run at all. An agent editing its own tool surface is ordinary work, and until now
// it could merge a `.github/atomaton/` that stops the next run from starting: atoma
// resolves every name in an agent's `mcp_servers` against tools.yaml and aborts
// before a single server starts, so the failure landed on whoever triggered the
// next run rather than on this pull request. See `scripts/validate_deliverable.ts`.

/**
 * Where the pull request's own tree is checked out, beside the default-branch one.
 *
 * This job runs on the default branch — `gh workflow run` with no `--ref` — so its
 * first checkout is the machinery: the scripts, and the atoma binary's version. The
 * content being judged is the pull request's, and it has to be fetched separately.
 *
 * That separation is the whole security story of this step. Everything under here is
 * DATA: a YAML file parsed, agent definitions and a tools file handed to a binary
 * downloaded from a release. Nothing in it is executed, nothing in it decides how
 * the validation behaves, and no script is loaded from it — which matters because
 * this job holds `checks: write` and could otherwise be made to write its own
 * passing check.
 *
 * The head branch is always in this repository: this workflow is dispatched for
 * pull requests agents open on `atoma/issue-N` branches. A fork's head would not
 * resolve here, and does not arrive here.
