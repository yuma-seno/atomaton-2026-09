// Runs whatever config.yaml's `checks.atomaton_runs.commands` says verifies this project.
//
// It exists so that a project's verification is something an agent can write.
// GITHUB_TOKEN is refused on `.github/workflows/**` by identity -- on every path
// and every branch, measured -- so an agent asked to set up CI for a new
// repository cannot author a workflow. It can author configuration, and this
// workflow is the fixed shell that runs it. Nothing here changes per project;
// everything that does lives in config.yaml.
//
// A repository that already has CI does not need this: name that workflow in
// `checks.your_workflow` instead of filling in `checks.atomaton_runs`, and the job
// says so and passes rather than failing over an empty list. The two are
// alternatives -- declaring both is a configuration error, not a precedence rule.
//
// Two triggers, because the two kinds of pull request arrive differently.
//
// An agent's pull request is opened with GITHUB_TOKEN, and GitHub starts no
// workflow run for its own token's events -- so `pull_request` never fires for
// it. `validate_pull_request.ts` dispatches this workflow instead and mirrors the
// result onto the head commit where a ruleset can see it.
//
// A person's pull request does fire `pull_request`, and nothing was dispatching
// this workflow for one. Since this is what `checks.your_workflow` defaults to, that left
// a repository with no CI at all for its human contributors -- a required check
// that never ran, and a merge refused for a missing check until someone
// dispatched it by hand. So `pull_request` is listed too, and it is inert for the
// agent case by the same rule that made it necessary for the human one.
