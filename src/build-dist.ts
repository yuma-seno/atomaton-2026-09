/**
 * build-dist.ts — Bundles every deployable entry-point script (via
 * `Bun.build`) from its `src/` source into the mirrored `dist/.github/`
 * location:
 *   - `src/scripts/**` (this repo's own workflow-automation glue, invoked
 *     directly from a `*.wac.ts` file's `run:` step) -> `dist/.github/scripts/`.
 *   - `src/atoma/tools/scripts/**` (Atoma's own MCP servers, `before_tool`
 *     hook, and the one-shot scripts they use) -> `dist/.github/atoma/tools/scripts/`.
 *   - Atoma's static, non-code content (`config.json`, `prompt-template.md`,
 *     agent definitions, recursive skill Markdown, and `tools/tools.yaml`) ->
 *     `dist/.github/atoma/`,
 *     copied verbatim (nothing to bundle).
 *
 * Every entry point is bundled with ALL of its imports inlined -- including
 * the shared `src/lib/**` kernel (so `src/scripts/**` and
 * `src/atoma/tools/scripts/**` can freely import shared code without any
 * hand-duplicated files between them) and npm dependencies like
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (so the deployed output needs no
 * `node_modules`/`package.json`/`bun install` step at all -- verified: a
 * bundled `mcp/github.ts` runs standalone with zero dependencies nearby).
 * Bundled output keeps a `.ts` extension (Bun happily runs plain JS through
 * a `.ts`-named file) so every existing `bun run .github/.../foo.ts`
 * reference -- in generated workflow YAML, `tools.yaml`, `ScriptRef`'s
 * runtime-path derivation -- needs no change.
 *
 * `.test.ts` files are excluded from entry-point discovery -- tests are a
 * dev-time concern for this repo, not something end users need in their
 * own `.github/`. `dist/.github/` is fully generated output: nothing under
 * it should ever be hand-edited directly.

 * reaches `onnxruntime-node`, whose `.node` binaries are not JavaScript and so
 * are not something a JavaScript bundler can carry. Inlining the wrapper and
 * losing the binary produces a script that builds and then fails at its first
 * call, which is the worst of both.
 *
 * Anything added here has to be installed by the runner before an agent starts
 * — see `mcp-packages.json`'s `bun` list and the workflow step that reads it.
