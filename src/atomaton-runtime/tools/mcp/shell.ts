 * has no sudo, which is what makes the rest of the arrangement mean anything: with
 * sudo, `cat /proc/<pid>/environ` reads any process whatever else is arranged.

 * It holds no credentials of its own (`env: {}` under `tools.servers`). What it can and

// The cap and the direction of the cut both come from `domain/tool-output.ts`.
// This server had its own `MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES = 1_000_000`, which was twenty times
// every other tool's and, on its own, more than a 200k context window -- and it kept
// the HEAD, so a build log that overran lost the compiler error and returned the
// banner. See that module for the measurements.

/**
 * Variables holding a credential, if this process was handed any.
 *
 * On a runner it is handed none, and this list is empty. Two things say so:
 * `tools.servers` gives this server `env: {}`, and Atoma strips every credential
 * from a server that does not name one. The literal-value pass below therefore
 * finds nothing to remove, and only the shape patterns do any work.
 *
 * A third reason used to be here — "this process runs in a container
 * that cannot see the servers which DO hold them" — and the confinement rework removed the
 * container. What stands in its place protects the OTHER servers rather than this
 * one: they make themselves unreadable. It is not a reason this list is empty, so
 * it does not belong in this comment.
 *
 * `redact_stream.ts` says the same thing about its own situation; this comment
 * used to claim the opposite, describing an environment the server had before
 * per-tool credential routing existed.
 *
 * It is kept for the case where the values ARE present: a hand-run `atoma` with
 * the keys exported in the shell. There the literal pass is the stronger of the
 * two, since an exact value needs no pattern to guess at.
 *
 * `ATOMA_PROVIDER` and the rest of the run's configuration are absent on
 * purpose. They are not secret, and redacting a value like `openai` would blank
 * every mention of the word.

Set timeout_seconds for commands that may run longer than five minutes. Commands run on the same machine, as the same user, and with the same filesystem as every other tool: a file you write in the repository is the same file github__* commits and filesystem__* reads, at the same path. Writes OUTSIDE the repository mostly fail rather than silently not persisting: $HOME is not writable and system packages cannot be installed. $HOME itself also cannot be LISTED -- `ls ~` is refused -- while paths under it can be read and executed, so use `command -v` or a direct path rather than listing the home directory to find a toolchain. /tmp is writable. Within it, `/tmp/atoma-workspace` is the one place that SURVIVES: anything you leave there is restored on the next run on this issue and is shared with the other agents working on it. Put notes, scratch scripts and intermediate output there rather than in the repository, where they would be committed as part of the work. Elsewhere under /tmp is fine for scratch that does not need to outlive the run. That is a real error you can read, not a write that looks like it worked. If something must persist, add it to `environment.setup_commands` in .github/atomaton/config.yaml and say so in your report; a person merges that and the next run has it. Some commands are routed to MCP tools instead of running here -- Git mutations, `gh`, `curl`, `wget`, `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync` -- and the set may grow, so read the refusal rather than assuming a fixed list: each one names the tool to use in its place. Read-only Git inspection (status, diff, log) runs normally. Output is capped: a long stdout or stderr keeps its beginning and its END, with a marker naming how much was dropped from the middle, and `output_truncated` set. So a build log keeps its failure -- but if you see that marker, narrow the command (a specific test, `grep`, `tail`) rather than re-running the same one and expecting more.",
