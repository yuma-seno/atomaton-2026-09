/**
 * atoma.ts — MCP server exposing Atomaton orchestration tools.
 *
 * Transport: stdio, via the official @modelcontextprotocol/sdk.
 *
 * Tools:
 *   - launch_sub_agent: Launch Atomaton agents on sub-issues and end the
 *     orchestrator session.
 *   - request_close_issue: Conclude work on the current issue.
 *   - reload_environment: Re-run the project's setup as a workflow step and start
 *     a new run, for the things an agent cannot do to its own environment.
 *
 * Both tool responses include `_meta.session_ends: true` so the Atoma core
 * can detect that the session should terminate.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this process's `process.stdout` IS the JSON-RPC transport --
 * never `console.log()` anywhere in this file or in anything it calls
 * in-process (dispatchSubAgent/concludeIssue and whatever they import);
 * always `console.error()` (stderr) for logging.
