/**
 * search.ts — finds the issues, and the code, that answer a question.
 *
 * Two stages, and the division of labour matters. BM25 casts a net over every
 * passage of every issue and comment; a cross encoder then reads the twenty
 * issues it caught and decides which of them actually answers what was asked.
 * The first stage is not semantic and does not need to be — its only job is to
 * avoid losing the answer before the second stage sees it.
 *
 * Measured over this repository, 181 issues and 22 questions phrased the way an
 * agent phrases them:
 *
 *   BM25 alone, recall@20 ......... 100%
 *   plus the cross encoder, top 1 .. 91%, top 3 100%
 *
 * A dense vector index alongside BM25 changed the final ranking on none of the
 * 22, which is why there is no embedding model here, no vector store, and
 * nothing to re-embed when an issue is edited. Enlarging the embedding model
 * 16-fold changed nothing either; enlarging the reranker moved top 1 from 27%
 * to 91%. The whole budget belongs to the second stage.
 *
 * Ask it a question, not a keyword. Phrasing the query as a sentence rather
 * than a title was worth more than every other change combined — recall at 5
 * went from 48% to 95% on the same index with the same models. Which is why the
 * tool description spends its length on how to phrase the question: the caller
 * writes the query, so the caller holds the largest lever on the result.
 *
 * The same reasoning makes the language of the query part of the contract. The
 * first stage matches character bigrams and nothing else, so a question asked
 * in a language the issues are not written in shares no bigrams with them and
 * scores near zero — the answer never reaches the cross encoder, which is
 * multilingual and would have recognised it. An agent reads English
 * instructions while this repository's issues are Japanese, so this is a live
 * hazard rather than a theoretical one, and the description says so outright.
