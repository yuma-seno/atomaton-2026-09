/**
 * web.ts — fetches a URL for the agent.
 *
 * Three things it does that a bare `curl` through the shell does not:
 *
 * Converts to Markdown by default. Raw HTML is mostly markup, and every byte of
 * a tool result is resent on each later inference of the run, so a page fetched
 * as HTML is paid for many times over. `raw: true` is there for the cases where
 * the markup is the point.
 *
 * Returns a picture as a picture. The core carries image blocks from a tool
 * result now, so a URL that resolves to an image reaches a vision-capable model
 * as something it can look at rather than as base64 in the prose.
 *
 * Bounds the response. A page with no limit can spend an entire context window
 * in one call.

 * handles `file:` URLs, and this server declares `env: {}` precisely so that it
 * holds no credentials.
 *
 * That made it the cheapest way to reach the two places a credential actually
 * sits — `/proc/<pid>/environ` of a server that does hold one, and the
 * `http.extraheader` line `actions/checkout` writes into `.git/config` — without
 * going anywhere near the `shell` server or the routing rules that watch it.
 *
 * Checked here rather than in the handler so the constraint is in the JSON Schema
 * the model reads, and so a rejected call names the reason.
