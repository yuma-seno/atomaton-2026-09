/**
 * workspace_guard.ts — tells the agent when its scratch workspace has grown past
 * what will be carried into the next run, while it can still do something about it.
 *
 * Invoked as an `after_tool` hook declared once in `tools.watch`, so it runs after
 * every call to every server. See `domain/workspace-size.ts` for why it is every server
 * and why the check is here rather than where the workspace is saved.
 *
 * ## What it answers
 *
 * `{"notice": "..."}` on stdout, which Atoma appends to the result the agent is already
 * reading. Anything else — no output, a crash, a timeout — adds nothing and the call it
 * followed is unaffected. That is the contract this side is written to: an after-hook
 * reports on work that has already happened, so this file never fails a tool call, and
 * every error path below ends in silence rather than in an exception.
 *
 * ## Why it walks the tree on every call
 *
 * The measured workspace is five files. Walking it costs microseconds, and the walk
 * stops early once it has seen enough to know the answer, so the pathological case —
 * somebody copied `node_modules` in — is the cheapest one to detect rather than the most
 * expensive. What it must not do is cache: the file that matters is the one written by
 * the call that just finished.
