/**
 * shell_guard.ts — Steer the agent to the MCP tool that does the job properly,
 * and refuse the one read that leaks another tool server's credentials.
 *
 * Invoked directly as an executable (not via an interpreter argument) by the
 * Atoma core's `before_tool` hook mechanism, which spawns the configured script
 * path and pipes JSON on stdin. When a command is refused, the reason string is
 * surfaced to the agent as an error, so each reason names the tool to use
 * instead.
 *
 * ## This is NOT a security boundary, and nothing here relies on it being one
 *
 * It is a text match over a shell command line. `a=curl; $a example.com` defeats
 * every rule below, and no amount of pattern work changes that: the shell
 * resolves variables after this hook has already decided. Saying so plainly is
 * the point — a guard that overstates itself makes the person reviewing the pull
 * request review it less carefully.
 *
 * This file used to carry a second layer whose only job was to make the first
 * layer hard to evade: command tokenization to undo `w\get` and `cu""rl`,
 * substitution of declared variables into the text, refusal of `PATH` and
 * `LD_PRELOAD`, and rules against `bash -c`, `eval`, `python -c`, heredocs and
 * `base64 | sh`. All of it is gone, because it was defending a boundary this is
 * not. An agent is not an adversary: it does not obfuscate a command to get past
 * a rule that exists to help it, so evasion resistance bought nothing and cost
 * two thirds of the file.
 *
 * What survives is two kinds of rule, and they are kept apart on purpose because
 * they are not the same kind of thing:
 *
 *   1. ROUTING — commands that would work badly or not at all, where a tool
 *      exists that works properly. Their value is iterations not wasted.
 *   2. HARDENING — exactly one rule, for the one real threat nothing else
 *      covers. Honest about being partial. See PROCESS_ENVIRONMENT_READ.

/**
 * The one rule that is not routing.
 *
 * Each tool server holds the credentials its `tools.servers` entry declares, and a
 * process reading `/proc/<pid>/environ` of another server obtains a credential it
 * was deliberately not given.
 *
 * **The structural fix has landed, and this is no longer the thing standing
 * between them.** The servers that hold a credential make themselves
 * non-dumpable, so the kernel refuses the read — measured, and measured with the
 * credential still sitting in the environment block, which is the point: it locks
 * the entry rather than the value. See `../lib/harden.ts`.
 *
 * That replaced a rootless container with its own PID namespace. The
 * container hid the other servers outright, and the reason it went is not that it
 * failed at this: it gave the shell a different filesystem from every other tool,
 * and a write to $HOME inside it succeeded and then was not there for anything
 * else. The confinement design carries the measurements and the three-way trade.
 *
 * This rule is kept for two cases the flag does not cover. A hand-run `atoma`
 * where a server is an ordinary sibling process. And a THIRD-PARTY server, which
 * cannot be made to harden itself and whose credential is therefore readable —
 * documented as such rather than pretended away.
 *
 * In both it stops an accident and not an intent: `P=/proc; cat $P/1/environ`
 * walks straight past it, exactly as the header says of every rule in this file.
 *
 * So: still worth having, no longer load-bearing. Do not restore a dependency on
 * it.
 *
 * Matched as "both words anywhere" rather than as the literal path. Matching
 * `/proc/<pid>/environ` was the first attempt and its own test broke it:
 * `find /proc -name environ -exec cat {} +` never writes that path, it builds
 * it. The readers are endless too — cat, head, xxd, tr, dd, od, strings, a bare
 * `< /proc/N/environ` — and enumerating either the readers or the spellings is
 * the shape of check this repository has been wrong about three times.
 *
 * `/proc` as a whole stays open: `environ` is the part that matters, and cpuinfo
 * and meminfo have honest uses. `\benviron\b` does not match `environment`, so
 * ordinary words and filenames are unaffected.
