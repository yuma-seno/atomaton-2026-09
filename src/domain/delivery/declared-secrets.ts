/**
 * declared-secrets.ts — which repository secrets each workflow may reach, and
 * why the list has to be declared rather than discovered.
 *
 * Something a project runs — a tool server, a check, a deployment — often needs a
 * credential, and the credential belongs in repository secrets. Getting it from
 * there into the process is the awkward part: a step's `env:` is a static YAML
 * map, so every secret a workflow can reach is named at the moment that file is
 * generated — which is upstream, and which no adopter should have to edit.
 *
 * The way out is to reach the secret through a COMPUTED key,
 * `secrets[fromJSON(...)[i]]`, filling a fixed number of anonymous slots whose
 * meaning is decided at run time by whatever this module returns. The workflow
 * stops naming credentials; config.yaml names them instead.
 *
 * Two things were measured before building on this, because either would have
 * sunk it. GitHub's malicious-workflow detector blocks `toJSON(secrets)` — a run
 * containing it never starts, it only queues for approval — but it allows a
 * computed key. And a computed key still gets the ordinary masking: the value
 * comes out of the log as `***`, exactly as `${{ secrets.NAME }}` would, which is
 * what makes this preferable to packing several credentials into one JSON secret
 * (which would also mean keeping the whole set outside GitHub, since a secret
 * cannot be read back to add one key to it).
 *
 * ## One mechanism, two kinds of declaration
 *
 * `tools.secrets` is a list for a whole workflow: the agent's own process gets
 * every name in it. A check or a deployment declares its credentials per entry
 * instead — see `domain/delivery/declared-jobs.ts` — so a token reaches the one job that
 * asked for it and no other. Both arrive here; what differs is who the list
 * belongs to.
 *
 * The separation is the boundary and not a filing convention: only
 * `tools.secrets` enters the agent's own environment, so a prompt injection
 * carried in an issue body reaches those and no deployment credential. It could
 * still propose a command that reads one — but that is a change to config.yaml,
 * which is governed, so a person sees it first.
 *
 * Collapsing these into one list would put every credential in every
 * destination while still looking like a boundary, which is worse than having
 * no boundary at all.
 *
 * The declaration lives in config.yaml rather than in a repository variable
 * because it is the most security-relevant setting this project has. In
 * config.yaml it is versioned, it shows up in a diff, and it passes the
 * governance gate that already covers `.github/**`. In repository settings it
 * would be invisible to everyone reviewing the repository — which is precisely
 * the audience for "what credentials can this reach".
