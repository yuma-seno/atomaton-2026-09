/**
 * issue-branch.ts — decides which branch an issue's work belongs on.
 *
 * Two questions, both pure: which existing branch a run should resume, and what
 * to call a new one. The I/O half — listing refs and asking GitHub which pull
 * requests merged — lives in the callers.
 *
 * The rule everything here follows is that a branch belongs to a unit of work,
 * not to an issue. An issue can produce a second piece of work after the first
 * has merged, and reusing the merged branch for it would build on a history the
 * base already contains.

 * Anchored at both ends, which is the whole point. Unanchored, the remainder of
 * `atomaton/issue-12-3` after the prefix for issue **1** is `2-3`, and a pattern
 * looking only for a trailing `-<digits>` finds one — so a run on issue 1 would
 * resume issue 12's branch, commit to it, and open a pull request from it.
 *
 * The check used to live in two places, the filter and the ordinal, each
 * unanchored in the same way. One arbiter now: an ordinal of 0 means the branch
 * is not this issue's, and nothing else decides ownership.
