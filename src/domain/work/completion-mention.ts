 * Whether to append the "no agent will run next" mention.
 *
 * Three ways work continues without a person, and each silences the mention:
 *
 * - The agent handed off, naming the next agent in its directive.
 * - A tool call already dispatched the next run — `create_pr` starting the
 *   reviewer, `launch_sub_agent` starting the children.
 * - A closed sub-issue. Closing one is what wakes its parent: the aggregation
 *   gate re-invokes the parent's orchestrator once the last sibling lands, and
 *   until then the parent is what is waiting, not a person. The dispatch happens
 *   in a later workflow run, so `chainContinues` — which only sees this run —
 *   cannot know about it.
 *
 * A sub-issue that is still OPEN is deliberately not in that list. Nothing wakes
 * a parent for a sub-issue that has not finished, so a run that ends there has
 * genuinely stopped, and that is exactly the case a person needs to hear about.
 *
 * The hand-off is the one of the three that can be contradicted, and the ending is
 * what already knows: a turn that was stopped, spent, or that failed outright
 * carries no `next` at all, so the plan it wrote silences nothing. The other two
 * are not contradictable — a tool that already dispatched has already dispatched,
 * and a closed sub-issue still wakes its parent, whether or not the run that closed
 * it was stopped afterwards.
 *
 * `chain-over` carries a `next` and silences, which looks like an exception and is
 * not: the chain's own limit posts a comment naming that agent and mentioning the
 * same person. Silencing here is what keeps one event to one notification.
