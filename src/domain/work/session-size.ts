/**
 * session-size.ts — keeping a session inside the model's context window.
 *
 * # The failure this exists for
 *
 * A session accumulates across runs, because `session_mode: continue` restores
 * the history on purpose. Past the model's window the provider answers `400`,
 * and nothing in atoma retries that -- it retries 429, 5xx and a truncated body.
 * So the run fails, the session stays as it was, and the next run fails for the
 * same reason. Forever.
 *
 * That is not a risk. Three of the stored sessions were already past 128k when
 * this was written, and for those issues that agent could never run again.
 *
 * # What is actually big, measured over 345 sessions and 5,666 tool calls
 *
 * ```text
 *   tool RESULTS   13.5 MB   59.2%
 *   tool CALLS      2.3 MB   10.0%     <- a sixth of the results
 *   everything else 7.0 MB   30.7%
 * ```
 *
 * One result's size: `p50 277  p75 1,372  p90 3,630  p99 20,083  max 823,859`
 * characters. **The largest 1% is most of the weight**, which is why a cap works
 * and why dropping by recency alone does not: in the worst session, a single
 * 823,859-character result sat inside the most recent twenty.
 *
 * # Two operations, at two different moments
 *
 * `capToolResults` runs when a session is SAVED, so it never grows in the first
 * place. `replaceOldToolResults` runs when a session is RESTORED and is still too
 * big, which after capping is the exception -- measured, 2 of 343.
 *
 * # Why the tool CALLS survive both
 *
 * The previous version dropped each result together with the `tool_calls` that
 * produced it. So an agent resuming lost the record of **what it had already
 * looked at** -- and the cost was measured: a run that made 169 distinct
 * searches and reported nothing. An agent that cannot see what it searched
 * searches again.
 *
 * Keeping the calls costs almost nothing. In the worst session it is 25 KB
 * against 2,717 KB of results: **1%** of what dropping the results saves.
 *
 * # The one structural rule
 *
 * A `tool` message answers an assistant message's `tool_calls`, and every provider
 * rejects a conversation where one appears without the other. Neither operation
 * here removes a message, so the pairing cannot be broken by either -- which is
 * the same invariant `answer_unanswered_tool_calls` enforces in the core.

/**
 * How much of one tool result is kept in a saved session.
 *
 * 4,000 characters, and the number is where the curve turns. Measured across all
 * 5,666 stored results:
 *
 * ```text
 *   cap      total tokens   over 100k   results left whole
 *   none      5,422,514         7       5666/5666
 *    1000     2,991,796         0       3889/5666 (68.6%)
 *    4000     3,686,213         2       5154/5666 (91.0%)
 *    8000     4,021,523         3       5441/5666 (96.0%)
 * ```
 *
 * Going down to 1,000 saves 19% more and costs 22 points of results left whole;
 * going up to 8,000 buys 5 points and costs 9% more storage. 4,000 also lands on
 * the measured `p90` of 3,630, so nine results in ten are untouched.
 *
 * And it is enough to be useful: 1,000 characters of head and 3,000 of tail holds
 * a build log's errors and its summary. At a 1,000 cap the tail is 750 characters,
 * which cuts a stack trace in half.
 *
 * Deliberately fixed rather than configurable, for the reason `SESSION_TOKEN_LIMIT`
 * is not per-model: a knob invites tuning without measurement. Changing it should
 * mean bringing a measurement.

 * for, and a truncated request reads as a different request. Measured, they are
 * small: `p50 114  p90 362  p99 3,828`. Exactly one call in 5,666 exceeded 20,000
 * characters — a `filesystem__write_file`.

/**
 * How many of the most recent tool results keep their content when a restored
 * session is still too big.
 *
 * Not a size decision. Measured, the difference between keeping none and keeping
 * twenty is 1–14% of the session, because the cap and the replacement do the work:
 *
 * ```text
 *   keepRecent:      0        5       10       20      all
 *      67,721   67,853   68,060   68,468  110,825   issue-174-engineer

 * ```
 *
 * It is a decision about how much of "where was I" a resumed run gets. Everything
 * restored is from a PREVIOUS run and therefore stale, which argues for few; but
 * the last few results are exactly what a run stopped by `/stop` needs in order not
 * to start over, which argues for some. Ten is roughly the last two or three turns
