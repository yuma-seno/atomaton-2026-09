/**
 * dispatch-chain.ts — how many times agents have handed work to each other with
 * nobody else saying anything.
 *
 * ## What this replaced, and why it could not fire
 *
 * The count used to live in `session.json`, advanced by `manage_dispatch_loop.ts`,
 * and reset whenever the run saw a new GitHub event. It never reached 1.
 *
 * The reset was meant to say "a person intervened, so start counting again". What
 * it actually said was "anything appeared in the issue" -- and `post_result_comment`
 * posts one comment per run. The next agent in the chain sees the previous agent's
 * result comment as a new event, resets to zero, hands off, and so on. `LOOP_LIMIT`
 * was unreachable, the comment telling a person the chain had stopped could not be
 * posted, and `decide_guard_release` always received `loop-limit-reached=false`.
 *
 * Its unit tests were green. Three of the four passed `newEventCount = 0`, which
 * the workflow cannot produce: the agent step only runs when `new_event_count != 0`,
 * and when it does not run the loop-control step is skipped along with it. The
 * branch that incremented the counter was covered and unreachable at the same time.
 *
 * ## Counting rather than storing
 *
 * `CI_RETRY_LIMIT` is the only cross-run limit in this repository that works, and
 * its own comment says why: it is "counted from its own comments rather than held
 * anywhere, so it survives a re-dispatch and needs no state of its own".
 *
 * So this does the same. Walk the target's comments from the newest backwards,
 * stop at the first one a person wrote, and count the agent result comments in
 * between. There is no counter to reset, no session field to migrate, and no
 * input a test can pass that the workflow could not.
 *
 * `post_result_comment` runs before the loop-control step, so the current run's own
 * comment is already there and is included. A tally of 1 means "this run, and
 * nothing before it".
 *
 * ## Issue and pull request count separately, on purpose
 *
 * A chain that moves from an issue to a pull request starts again from zero,
 * because the comments are on a different object. That is the right answer rather
 * than a gap: opening a pull request IS progress. The point is to catch repetition
 * that goes nowhere, not to cap how long a legitimate piece of work may take.

 * the value for a repository that has not thought about it yet.
 *
 * Exported because the comment a person receives when a chain stops names the

 *
 * Reading a bot as a person resets the tally, which is the defect this module
 * exists to fix -- the limit silently never fires. Reading a person as a bot makes
 * the limit fire early, which escalates to a person. One failure hides a runaway
 * chain; the other interrupts a working one. So the uncertain cases go to the side
 * that interrupts.
