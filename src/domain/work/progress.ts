/**
 * progress.ts — stopping a chain that is not getting anywhere, rather than one
 * that is merely long.
 *
 * # Why a count of runs is the wrong thing to count
 *
 * A limit on consecutive handoffs is worth having, but a count of
 * runs is a proxy and a poor one in both directions. One chain spent 2,299k tokens and
 * **finished the work**; a pointless loop can spend 30k and finish nothing. Cutting
 * on volume stops the large legitimate job and lets the small useless one run.
 *
 * The direct signal is simpler: **did the run change anything?** An engineer that
 * ran and pushed nothing changed nothing. Two of those in a row is repetition, and
 * it fires sooner than any run-count limit while leaving a long piece of real work
 * alone.
 *
 * # Counted from the comments, not stored
 *
 * The same discipline as `dispatch-chain.ts`, and for the reason its own comment
 * gives: the counter that used to live in `session.json` could not reach 1, because
 * it reset on any new event and every run posts a comment. So each result comment
 * carries what the run did (`CHANGED_TAG`), and this walks backwards over them.
 *
 * # What ends the walk
 *
 * Anything that is not an agent result comment saying it changed nothing. A
 * person's comment, a comment from the machinery -- "PR #N created" -- or a result
 * comment that did change something, all stop it.
 *
 * That is deliberately generous. A run that ends by creating a pull request posts
 * no result comment at all (its tool posts one instead), so its progress would
 * otherwise be invisible and the runs either side of it would look consecutive.
 * Stopping at anything unrecognised means this under-fires rather than over-fires,
 * and under-firing is the right direction: the cost of missing one loop is some
 * wasted runs, and the cost of interrupting real work is real work interrupted.
