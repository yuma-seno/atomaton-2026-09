/**
 * session.ts — shared `Session`/`SessionMessage` shape for the
 * `session.json` files this repo reads and mutates at several points
 * (persisted on the orphan `atomaton-data` branch, restored/saved via
 * `restore_agent_session.ts`/`save_agent_session.ts`, and read/mutated
 * in-place by `reconcile_github_session.ts`, `record_run_metadata.ts`,
 * `manage_dispatch_loop.ts`, `inject_uncommitted_notice.ts`, and
 * `lib/inject-sub-results.ts`). The one canonical definition, replacing 5
 * independently-hand-rolled (near-identical, slightly-narrowed-per-use)
 * local interfaces.
 *
 * This is a TS-side reasonable SUBSET of the real shape the `atoma` Rust
 * core itself reads/writes (see that sibling repo's `src/domain/session.rs`
 * if the exact wire format ever needs re-verifying against the actual
 * source of truth) -- the `[key: string]: unknown` index signature on both
 * interfaces exists specifically so a script that only cares about a few
 * fields can still round-trip the rest of a real session.json untouched.
