/**
 * unattended-pull-request.ts — whether a new pull request has anyone coming for it.
 *
 * The `auto_triggers` entries that started a reviewer on a pull
 * request was opened, synchronised or marked ready. Nothing starts unless someone
 * asks, which is the rule the whole system now runs on -- an agent names the
 * reviewer, or a person types `/reviewer`.
 *
 * That rule has one failure mode, and it is silent: an agent opens a pull request,
 * names no reviewer, mentions nobody, and the pull request sits. CI runs, the check
 * goes green, and the work waits for someone who was never told. Under the old
 * triggers this could not happen; making asking explicit made forgetting possible.
 *
 * So the machinery checks, mechanically, and says so. Not by guessing intent -- by
 * asking whether either of the two things that would bring a person or an agent is
 * present.

 *
 * A mention is `@` followed by a GitHub login. Deliberately loose: this decides
 * whether to add a notice, and a false positive costs a notice nobody needed while
 * a false negative leaves work unattended. Whether the mention reaches a real,
 * relevant person is a separate question, and a real one.

 * Whether the text mentions a GitHub login.

 * `@` at a word boundary, then GitHub's own login shape: alphanumerics and single
 * hyphens, 1-39 characters. The boundary before is what keeps an email address out
 * -- `someone@example.com` has a word character in front of the `@`.
 *
 * The lookahead after keeps a SCOPED PACKAGE out, which is the case that made this
 * fail when it was written: `bun add @huggingface/transformers` matched, because
 * `@huggingface` is exactly the shape of a login. A trailing `/` is what tells them
 * apart, and this repository's own pull request bodies contain the package form.
 *
 * A fenced code block is not excluded. A pull request body that mentions a person
 * only inside an example is unusual enough, and reading a notice nobody needed
 * costs less than leaving work unattended.
