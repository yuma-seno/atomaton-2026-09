/**
 * runner-label.ts — which machine a project's own commands run on.
 *
 * `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` was hardcoded in eleven files, and `config.yaml` could
 * not reach any of them. For a project that builds on macOS, or that needs a
 * self-hosted runner for a licensed toolchain or a GPU, `atomaton-check` and
 * `atomaton-deploy` were simply unusable -- and fixing them meant editing
 * `.github/workflows/**`, the one place `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot write. So neither an
 * agent nor a workflow could do it, and a hand-edited fork is overwritten by the
 * next upgrade. The same argument that put `checks.pull_request_runs.commands` in
 * `config.yaml` applies: a fact a project owns was living where the project cannot
 * reach it.
 *
 * ## Two jobs, not a matrix
 *
 * `runs-on` cannot read a file, so a small job reads `config.yaml` first and the
 * real job takes its output. Measured on a throwaway branch: asking for
 * `ubuntu-22.04` through a job output landed on `Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS`, while
 * `ubuntu-latest` is 24.04 -- so the value genuinely decides the machine.
 *
 * A matrix was measured too, and rejected for now. The check run's NAME changes
 * under one: `atomaton-check` becomes `atomaton-check (ubuntu-latest)`, so the context a
 * ruleset requires stops existing and every pull request waits forever on a check
 * that will never report. Avoiding that needs a third job to carry the required
 * name -- worth doing when somebody needs several runners at once, and not before.
 *
 * One runner with SEVERAL LABELS is a different thing and does work here: a
 * self-hosted runner is selected by a list, and that is the array form below.
 *
 * ## Not the agent's own runner
 *
 * `atomaton-runner` stays on Linux and this does not apply to it. What isolates a tool
 * server is Linux-only, top to bottom: `useradd` for the user with no sudo,
 * `setfacl` for POSIX ACLs granting traversal without read, `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE)`
 * through libc, and `/proc/<pid>/environ` being the thing that has to be closed.
 * macOS has none of it.
 *
 * Making that configurable would mean an agent's shell running with every one of
 * those protections silently absent. The answer is not a setting; it is that the
 * agent runs on Linux, and the machine a project's own commands need is a separate
 * question -- which is the one this answers.

 * addressed. Both end up as one job on one machine.
 *
 * Returns the default for anything unusable rather than failing: a workflow that
 * cannot start reports nothing about why, and the shipped default is a machine that
 * exists. `problems` says what was wrong, for `validate_deliverable` to surface at
 * pull request time, where it can be read.
