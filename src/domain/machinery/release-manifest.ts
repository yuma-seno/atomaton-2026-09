/**
 * release-manifest.ts — what a release says about itself.
 *
 * # Two questions an adopted repository could not answer
 *
 * **"Which release am I on?"** `docs/recipes.md` tells an adopter to name a
 * version rather than `latest`, and to record which one they took, because that is
 * what makes the next diff readable. It never gave them anywhere to record it, and
 * nothing in `.github/atomaton/` said. So the answer was memory, or downloading a zip
 * and diffing.
 *
 * **"What did upstream delete?"** The documented upgrade is `unzip -o` over the
 * tree, and that only ever overwrites. A file we removed stays in their repository
 * forever, and this is not cosmetic: a release deleted `atoma-auto-trigger.yml` and
 * `atoma-pr-review.yml` because work should start only when somebody asks. An
 * adopter who upgrades keeps both files, keeps the triggers, and keeps the
 * behaviour we removed — with nothing anywhere saying so.
 *
 * # What this is
 *
 * One JSON file in the release, carrying the version and every path the release
 * ships. The version answers the first question. The list answers the second:
 * anything under the paths we own that is not in the list is something upstream no
 * longer ships.
 *
 * It is data rather than a program on purpose. An adopter with a shell can answer
 * both questions from it, and so can we -- and neither has to trust a tool that
 * would have to be upgraded to be believed.

 * The manifest names itself. That is not a curiosity: an adopter comparing their
 * tree against the list would otherwise find the manifest itself in the tree and
 * not in the list, and conclude that upstream had deleted it.
