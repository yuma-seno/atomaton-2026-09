 * opinion held here. GitHub computes `mergeStateStatus` against whatever the
 * active ruleset requires, and the ruleset is a reviewed file
 * (`.github/atoma/rulesets/*.json`), so changing what "mergeable" means is a change to
 * that file — this module and the tools built on it follow automatically, with no
 * second definition to keep in step.
 *
 * That matters because the previous version WAS a second definition: it decided
 * on its own that checks must be green and conflicts absent. Anything the
 * repository required but this file did not know about went unenforced, and it
 * governed only the agent path — a person merging from the GitHub UI walked past
 * it entirely. Protection now applies to both, and this reports it.
 *
 * The remaining local input is `merge_policy`, which is Atoma's own concept and
