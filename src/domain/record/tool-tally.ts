/**
 * tool-tally.ts — what a run spent its iterations on, in one line.
 *
 * For the notice a person receives when a run hits its limit. Before
 * this it said only that the limit was reached, which does not distinguish the two
 * cases a person has to choose between: a run that was making progress and needs
 * more budget, and a run that was going round and needs the task re-scoped.
 *
 * A tally separates them at a glance. The run that prompted this made 215 tool
 * calls, 199 of them `shell__shell_execute` — and that shape is recognisable
 * without opening a session or a workflow log.
 *
 * Deliberately not a report. One was asked for, and the measurement refused it:
 * these agents write no prose until their final turn, so a run cut off before that
 * has nothing to say. The session survives for a retry either way, so nothing is
 * lost — what was missing was the one thing a person needed to decide, and this is
 * that and nothing more.
