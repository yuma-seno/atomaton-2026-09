/**
 * environment-reload.ts — how many times one piece of work may rebuild its
 * environment, and what the agent is told when it may not.
 *
 * ## What reloading is for
 *
 * `environment.setup_commands` runs as a workflow step, as `runner`, which has
 * passwordless sudo. The agent runs as `atomaton-tools`, which does not. So there is a
 * set of things an agent cannot do to its own environment at all:
 *
 *   - install a system package (`apt-get`)
 *   - install a global CLI (`/usr/local/lib` is not writable, and the runner
 *     closes the world-writable directories on PATH)
 *
 * And one it can do but should not have to: rebuilding a work tree it broke.
 *
 * Reloading re-runs the setup as a workflow step and dispatches the agent again.
 * The property that makes it safe is the split: **the commands come from the
 * default branch, the data from the work tree.** An agent can add a dependency to
 * `package.json` and get a trusted install command run against it, without being
 * able to edit the install command. Editing `setup.sh` would be arbitrary code
 * execution as a user with sudo; this is not that.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do, and why the message has to say so
 *
 * It cannot install a system package the default branch does not already ask for.
 * The commands come from there, so a package the agent decided it needs is not in
 * them yet -- that change goes through `environment.setup_commands`, which is a governed path
 * and needs a person. An agent that reloads hoping to get `libfoo-dev` gets the
 * same environment back and has spent a run finding out.
 *
 * ## Why there is a limit at all
 *
 * A reload starts a NEW RUN, and a run's own limits reset with it. Without a limit,
 * reloading is an unbounded extension of whatever bounds a run -- which is
 * why this was blocked: the budget that bounds a run cannot be bounded by
 * something the run can reset at will.
 *
 * Counted differently from the handoff limit in `dispatch-chain.ts`, and the
 * difference is not arbitrary. That one is derived from comments, because handoffs
 * leave comments. A reload leaves none, so there is nothing to count -- the tally
 * travels as a workflow input instead, which is what the proposal suggested.
 */

/**
 * How many times one piece of work may rebuild its environment.
 *
 * Three, matching `CI_RETRY_LIMIT` and for the same reason: enough for a fix that
 * needed another look, few enough that a genuinely stuck run reaches a person
 * quickly. There is no measured history to pick a better number from -- the tool
 * does not exist yet -- so it borrows the one limit here that has worked.

 * offered -- and would say so by removing `atoma_env` from the agent's `mcp_servers`.
