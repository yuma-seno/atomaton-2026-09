/**
 * path-patterns.ts — the one path-pattern form Atoma's configuration accepts.
 *
 * A pattern is a literal path, or a directory followed by `/**`. That is all.
 * Deliberately not a glob library, and the reason is not laziness: a
 * half-implemented glob is read as a full one. Someone writes `**\/*.sql`,
 * matches nothing, and their gate silently never fires -- which is worse than no
 * gate at all, because they believe they have one.
 *
 * So the form is small AND checked. `pathPatternProblem` rejects anything this
 * matcher cannot honour, and both callers -- `merge.gates` and
 * `merge.governed_paths` -- report that as a configuration problem rather than
 * matching zero files and carrying on. A pattern that cannot work says so at the
 * moment it is read.
 *
 * `merge.governed_paths` was not checked for a while, and the header here claimed it
 * was. That is the worse half of the same mistake: a gate over the agent's own
 * limits, silently matching nothing, under a comment saying it could not.
 *
 * Extracted from `merge-readiness.ts`, where `governedPathsIn` had the matcher
 * inline. `merge.gates` needed the same one, and two copies of a security-shaped
 * comparison is exactly the arrangement that drifts.
