/**
 * metrics.ts — what the stored sessions say about how the agents are being run.
 *
 * ## Reading rather than recording
 *
 * Nothing here asks for a new record to be kept. Every number below is already in
 * `atoma-data`: a session holds every tool call an agent made, in order, with the
 * arguments it passed and the result it got back. Half the work turned out to be
 * reading what is there, and the week that followed proved it three times — the search
 * guard's threshold, the cause of a 6.4M-token run, and the finding that the
 * edit/verify loop does not occur at all were each read out of these files.
 *
 * That is also why sessions are kept permanently. An aggregate answers the
 * questions it was built to answer. The raw sessions answer the ones nobody has thought
 * of yet, and all three of those started as questions nobody had thought of.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * **Money.** Four providers, and only one of them reports a cost; a price table goes
 * quietly stale and then prints confident wrong numbers. Tokens are the axis instead:
 * measured, comparable across providers, and anybody who knows their own rate can
 * multiply. Cost display was removed elsewhere for the same reason.
 *
 * **Averages, where a distribution is the point.** One run spent 54M tokens. Any mean
 * containing it describes nothing; the percentiles say what a normal run costs and what
 * the tail looks like, separately.
