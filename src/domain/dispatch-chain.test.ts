 *
 * Three of its four cases passed `newEventCount = 0`, an input the workflow cannot
 * produce: the agent step only runs when `new_event_count != 0`, and when it does
 * not run the loop-control step is skipped with it. So the branch that advanced the
 * counter was covered and unreachable at once, and the limit never fired in a year
 * of runs.
 *
 * The lesson shapes these: every input here is a comment list of the shape
 * `repos/{repo}/issues/{n}/comments` actually returns, built from the real tag
 * writers rather than from hand-typed HTML comments. A case that cannot happen on
 * GitHub cannot be written without noticing.
