/**
 * code-search.ts — finding the code that answers a question, rather than the lines
 * that contain a word.
 *
 * # What was measured, and what it decided
 *
 * The same two stages as the issue search: BM25 casts a net, a cross encoder reads the
 * twenty passages it caught. Against this repository's 266 files and 5,053 passages:
 *
 * ```text
 *   query form                            n   recall@1   recall@5   recall@20
 *   regex fragments (machine-labelled)  142      12.7%      41.5%       64.8%
 *   whole questions (hand-labelled)      30      36.7%      70.0%      93.3%
 * ```
 *
 * Same index, same BM25, same corpus. **Only the query changed.** Which is the same
 * finding the issue search made — phrasing was worth more than every other change
 * combined — and it is why the tool description spends its length on how to ask.
 *
 * The two rows are labelled differently on purpose. The fragments are every search in
 * the stored sessions paired with the file the agent opened next, which is a noisy
 * label: reading them, perhaps half are "what it opened next" rather than what it was
 * looking for. The questions are hand-written from the intents those fragments reveal,
 * with labels checked by hand. The absolute figures differ in how much they can be
 * trusted; the contrast does not, because both ran against the same index.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment claimed 96.7% and 80%. Those were measured on a
 * CRLF checkout, where `splitBody` never splits on a blank line — `\r\n\r\n` has no
 * two adjacent newlines — so the passages were 3,368 instead of 5,053 and coarser than
 * anything production builds. The numbers above are on the runner's chunks.
 *
 * **No embedding model, and no vector store.** A dense index changed nothing for
 * issues; for code the first stage already hands the answer to the reranker 93.3% of
 * the time for a well-phrased question, and a reranker cannot help with what never
 * reaches it. Two cheaper ideas were measured and thrown out as well:
 *
 * ```text
 *   splitting identifiers at index time   +1.4 points
 *   chunking at declaration boundaries    -2.8 points  (worse)
 * ```
 *
 * The second one is worth recording because it sounded right: this repository writes
 * long doc comments that state intent in prose, and keeping a comment with the
 * declaration it documents should have bridged "retry logic" to `backoff_delay`. It
 * did not. The existing rule — headings, then blank lines — beats it.
 *
 * # A question in the wrong language reaches nothing
 *
 * Measured on the first real use: three Japanese questions against this English
 * corpus, and the answer was outside the top twenty for all three. The files that
 * answer them share **zero** tokens with the question; what comes back is whichever
 * files happen to contain Japanese, which here is a test fixture.
 *
 * That is not a caveat to document and hope about. The description said it, and the
 * agent asked in Japanese anyway — because the issue it was working on was Japanese,
 * which is the natural thing to do. So `queryCoverage` measures it instead: the
 * fraction of the question's own tokens the corpus has any word for.
 *
 * ```text
 *   30 English questions   min 98.1%, median 100%
 *   4 Japanese questions   12.0%  13.9%  14.3%  19.4%
 * ```
 *
 * Any threshold between 30% and 60% flags all four and none of the thirty. Nothing
 * about it knows what a language is, so it holds for one nobody here anticipated.
 *
 * # A name that does not exist is a separate failure, and needs a separate signal
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment claimed coverage also caught a question built
 * from invented identifiers. It does not, and the verification run showed it:
 * `how does the FrobnicatorWidget reconcile its ZuffleBuffer` scores **96.3%** and is
 * answered with three unrelated files. The reason is the tokenizer. An invented name
 * that looks like English is made of bigrams an English corpus already has; only the
 * whole-identifier token is missing, and it is one token among dozens.
 *
 * So the name is checked as a name. A word the asker spells like an identifier — an
 * internal capital or an underscore — is a claim that the thing exists, and that claim
 * is either true of the index or it is not:
 *
 * ```text
 *   3 invented-name questions      flagged 3
 *   5 real-identifier questions    flagged 0
 *   the 30 hand-labelled questions flagged 0
 * ```
 *
 * It is a note attached to the results rather than a refusal, and that asymmetry is
 * deliberate. A foreign-language question has no salvageable result at all, so refusing
 * loses nothing. A missing name can be missing for innocent reasons, and one turned up
 * the moment this was measured against the real corpus: `session_size` is reported
 * missing although `src/domain/session-size.ts` is right there, because the tokenizer
 * splits on the hyphen and never forms that token. A name can also live in a file
 * `code-corpus.ts` excludes, or be one the run is about to create. Meanwhile the rest of
 * the question still ranks. A note costs a sentence when it is wrong; a refusal would
 * cost the answer — which is why the wording says "not under that spelling" rather than
 * "not in this codebase".
 *
 * One consequence worth knowing before trying the example above: naming an invented
 * identifier in a comment puts it in the index, so `FrobnicatorWidget` is now a word
 * this repository contains and no longer triggers its own illustration. Prose is
 * indexed exactly like code, which is what makes the search work at all.
 *
 * # No index is stored
 *
 * Measured, building the whole thing from nothing takes 275ms: 6ms to walk the tree,
 * 13ms to read every file, 3ms to split, 271ms for BM25. Against a reranker that takes
 * 55 seconds to load and an inference turn that takes 3.5 seconds, that is noise.
 *
 * So it is built per search, and the freshness question does not exist: the agent
 * edits a file and the next search sees the edit. The issue index is cached on
 * `atomaton-data` for a reason that does not apply here — fetching issues needs the
 * network, and code is already on disk. The two share the word "index" and nothing
 * else.
