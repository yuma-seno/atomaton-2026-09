/**
 * deploy-targets.ts — what this project deploys, and which event deploys it.
 *
 * A deployment is a name, a trigger and a list of commands. It is configuration
 * rather than a workflow file because an agent can write configuration and
 * cannot write a workflow: GITHUB_TOKEN is refused on `.github/workflows/**` by
 * identity, on every path and every branch, so a project whose CD an agent is
 * expected to author has to express it somewhere else. Everything a deployment
 * actually does — building, uploading, calling a provider's CLI — is a command,
 * and commands are ordinary file content.
 *
 * ## Why the trigger is here and not in the workflow
 *
 * `atoma-deploy.yml` listens for every tag, and asks this module whether any
 * target wanted that one. It cannot listen selectively, because `on:` takes no
 * expression and so cannot be driven from configuration. Filtering after the
 * fact costs a few seconds of runner time on a tag nobody deploys, which is the
 * price of letting the pattern live somewhere an agent can edit.
 *
 * Merges cost nothing at all, because a merge does not start this workflow by
 * event: an agent's merge uses GITHUB_TOKEN and fires no `push`, so `dispatchCd`
 * starts the run explicitly. It asks this module first and does not dispatch
 * when nothing matches.
 *
 * Schedules are deliberately absent. A cron expression can only be written in
 * `on:`, so it cannot come from configuration, and a fixed daily cron that
 * checks the time in a script burns 24 runs a day to do nothing.
