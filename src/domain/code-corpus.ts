/**
 * code-corpus.ts — which of a project's files the code search reads.
 *
 * # Why `git ls-files` and not a configured list
 *
 * A template does not know where an adopter keeps their source. `git ls-files` is the
 * answer they already gave: it is exactly what the project tracks, it respects
 * `.gitignore`, and it needs no key in `config.yaml`, which is one fewer key to add.
 *
 * The I/O half is the caller's. This module decides what to keep.
 *
 * # Why the exclusions are what they are
 *
 * `.github/atoma/**` and `.github/atoma-runtime/**` are the DEPLOYED tree, generated
 * from `src/` by `build-dist.ts`. Excluding them serves both kinds of repository for
 * different reasons: in this one they are a second copy of `src/`, so a search would
 * return the copy; in an adopter's, they are Atoma's implementation, so a question
 * about their own project would be answered with ours.
 *
 * **Tests are indexed.** "Where is this tested" is a question worth answering, and
 * leaving them out would be a guess about what somebody else wants to find.
 *
 * # Why there is no size limit on a file
 *
 * A file too large to be about one thing still splits into passages that are, and a
 * passage that was never indexed cannot be found. The cost is bounded elsewhere:
 * measured, this repository is 251 files and 3,159 passages, and building the whole
 * index from nothing takes 275ms — which is why there is no cache either.
