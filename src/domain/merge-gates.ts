/**
 * merge-gates.ts — conditions under which an agent must not merge, declared by
 * the project rather than hardcoded here.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a required status check
 *
 * A required check stops everyone. The thing wanted here stops only the agent:
 * "a pull request that adds a database migration is a person's to merge" does not
 * mean the merge is forbidden, it means the judgement is not an agent's to make.
 * Branch protection cannot express that, because it does not know who is merging.
 *
 * `merge.governed_paths` already has exactly this property and is the model. It
 * says "changes under `.github/**` fall to a person", the agent reviews and reports,
 * and a person merges. What it lacks is expressiveness: it matches paths and
 * nothing else, so `db/migrations/**` is sayable but "only when a migration is
 * ADDED" is not. These gates are that generalisation.
 *
 * ## Why declarative rather than a script
 *
 * The first proposal was a script per gate, spawned like `tools.yaml`'s
 * `before_tool` hook, with the exit code as the verdict. It is more expressive --
 * a script can read a migration and notice it drops a production table, which no
 * amount of configuration can.
 *
 * It is also the one decision here that is hard to take back, and it buys that
 * expressiveness with four new failure modes: a timeout, a crash whose default
 * has to be chosen, a program that must itself be read from the machinery rather
 * than from the pull request under review, and arbitrary code on the path that
 * decides whether that code may merge. Configuration has none of those. It is
 * read from `config.yaml`, which `loadConfig()` already resolves under
 * `ATOMA_MACHINERY_ROOT`, so a pull request cannot weaken the gate judging it --
 * for free, with nothing to plumb.
 *
 * So: conditions now, and a script escape hatch left unbuilt until a real case
 * needs one. The shape here does not stand in the way of adding it -- a gate is
 * an object with a `reason`, and a `run` key alongside `when` would be additive.
 *
 * ## Why unknown keys are an error
 *
 * A typo in `files_added` matches nothing, and a gate that matches nothing looks
 * identical to a gate that was never needed. Nobody finds out until the merge
 * they wanted stopped goes through quietly. `DEFAULT_GOVERNED_PATHS` carries the
 * same lesson from the other direction: an enumeration that silently omitted
 * `.github/scripts/` let an agent merge changes to its own limits. Silence is the
 * failure mode to design against, so every key is checked and anything
 * unrecognised is reported.
