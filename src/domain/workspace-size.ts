/**
 * workspace-size.ts — when the scratch workspace has grown past what will be kept.
 *
 * ## Why this is checked during the run and not when the workspace is saved
 *
 * Saving happens after the agent has finished. A limit enforced there is correct and
 * useless: the run that wrote the 900 MB file is over, its `/tmp` is gone with the job,
 * and the next run restores the last version that *did* fit — so the agent that is told
 * has nothing to delete and did nothing wrong. The condition has to be reported while
 * the files still exist and the agent can still remove them.
 *
 * So this runs from an `after_tool` hook on every tool, and what it produces is a notice
 * appended to whatever result the agent was already reading. Every tool, because an
 * agent may write a large file through one server and then spend twenty calls in
 * another; a hook on the writing server alone would say nothing for those twenty.
 *
 * ## What the numbers are, and what they are not
 *
 * Measured over every issue this repository has run: the whole `workspace/` tree on
 * `atomaton-data` is **five files and 142 bytes**. The limits below are not tuned against
 * that distribution, because there is nothing there to tune against — they are set where
 * a legitimate use cannot reach and an accident lands immediately.
 *
 * ```text
 *   total       5 MB    ~37,000x the measured usage; one build artifact exceeds it
 *   one file    1 MB    separates "a big thing" from "many small things", which
 *                       have different causes and different fixes
 *   files        200    a copied node_modules trips this before it trips the bytes
 * ```
 *
 * The three exist separately because the notice has to say what to do, and "delete the
 * 900 MB bundle" and "you have copied a dependency tree in here" are different
 * sentences.
