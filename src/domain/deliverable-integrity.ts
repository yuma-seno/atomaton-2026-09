/**
 * deliverable-integrity.ts — whether the `.github/atoma/` a pull request would
 * merge is internally consistent, decided from its content and nothing else.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * A name in configuration that resolves to nothing is the one class of defect
 * this project keeps producing and cannot see. `mcp_servers: [filesystem]` with
 * no `filesystem` in tools.yaml aborts the whole run before a single server
 * starts; `labels.in_progres` guards work with a label nobody applies; an
 * A `merge_gates` entry that fails validation resolves the WHOLE list to empty,
 * so every trigger stops firing. Each of those is silent at merge time and
 * surfaces on whoever triggers the next run.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * No new validator is written here. Every rule below is either a reference that
 * either resolves or does not, or a call to a resolver that already exists and
 * already runs — `resolveMergeGates`,
 * `resolveDeployTargets`, `resolveDeclaredSecrets`. All four are pure functions of
 * a config value, and all four currently run too late to matter: at merge time, at
 * deploy time, when a credential is handed out. Running them at pull-request time
 * adds no opinion, it moves an existing one earlier.
 *
 * Anything that needs a run to find out is out of scope and stays out. Whether a
 * `checks.commands` entry passes, whether a deploy target's shell works, whether a
 * model answers — none of that is knowable from the files, and pretending
 * otherwise would make this a second, worse CI.
 *
 * ## Where the agent definitions and tools.yaml are checked
 *
 * Not here. `atoma validate --agent-def X.md --tools-file tools.yaml` already
 * checks the parse, `mcp_servers` against the tools file, `knows_about` targets,
 * `extra_body` reserved keys and the hook paths the tools
 * file names — using the same code the run itself uses. `validate_deliverable.ts`
 * calls it once per agent definition rather than reimplementing any of that in
 * TypeScript, which would be the same facts in two languages.
 *
 * So this module owns exactly one format: config.json, which is delivery's own and
 * which the core has never heard of.
