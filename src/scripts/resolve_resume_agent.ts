/**
 * resolve_resume_agent.ts — Decide which agent `/resume` means.
 *
 * `/resume` is `/<agent>` with the name filled in from what actually ran here, so a
 * person who wants to continue does not have to remember whether it was the engineer
 * or the reviewer. That is the only thing it does differently, which is why it takes
 * no instruction: `/<agent>` already resumes the same session AND carries one.
 *
 * The name is read from the thread rather than stored anywhere, the same choice
 * `dispatch-chain.ts` makes about handoffs. Every result comment already carries
 * `AGENT_TAG` -- `post_result_comment.ts` writes it so a later run can recognise its
 * own past output -- so the most recent one is the answer, and there is nothing extra
 * to keep in sync.
 *
 * Writes `agent` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT, empty when there is nothing to resume.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   resolve_resume_agent.ts --number N
