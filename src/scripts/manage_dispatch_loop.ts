/**
 * manage_dispatch_loop.ts — decide whether the agent chain has gone on long
 * enough to stop and ask a person.
 *
 * The I/O half. Every decision is in `domain/work/dispatch-chain.ts`, which explains
 * why this counts comments instead of keeping a counter -- briefly: the counter it
 * used to keep could not reach 1, because the reset fired on any new event and
 * every run posts a result comment.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   manage_dispatch_loop.ts --number 123 [--repo owner/name]
 *
 * Writes `auto_dispatch_count=N`, `loop_limit_reached=true|false`,
 * `handoff_limit=N`, `runs_without_change=N` and `stop_reason=<sentence>` to
 * $GITHUB_OUTPUT. The first two names are unchanged so the workflow's guards and
 * `decide_guard_release`'s input keep working.
 *
 * `loop_limit_reached` now covers two limits: consecutive handoffs and
 * consecutive runs that changed nothing. One guard, because the workflow's
 * response to both is the same -- withhold the handoff and tell a person -- and
 * `stop_reason` is what makes the message say which.
 *
 * No longer takes `--session`. Nothing is written back: the tally is derived, so
 * there is nothing to persist and nothing for a stale session to contradict. Old
 * sessions still carry `metadata.github_context.auto_dispatch_count`; it is dead
 * and nothing reads it.

 *
 * A failed read returns an empty list, which counts zero handoffs and lets the

 * deliberate: this bounds a loop that wastes model runs, and refusing to hand off
 * because GitHub was briefly unreachable would stop work that is going fine. The
