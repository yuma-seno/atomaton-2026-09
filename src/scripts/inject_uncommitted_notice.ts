/**
 * inject_uncommitted_notice.ts — Append a "please commit" notice to the
 * agent's session.json messages array. Used by atomaton-runner.wac.ts when the
 * agent's run left uncommitted working-tree changes.
 *
 * Usage: inject_uncommitted_notice.ts --session <path>
 *
 * ## Why the path is required now
 *
 * This used to search the work tree for the first file called `session.json`,
 * three levels deep, and fall back to that when given no argument. That was
 * harmless while the session lived in the repository root -- the search found the
 * intended file immediately.
 *
 * The session now lives outside the work tree, so the search would find nothing
 * here and, worse, could find something in an adopter's project. A repository with
 * a `session.json` fixture of its own would have this notice appended to THAT file,
 * committed by the same `git add -A` this notice exists to ask for. Searching for a
 * file by name in someone else's tree is not a fallback, it is a guess.
