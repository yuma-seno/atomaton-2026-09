/**
 * request_stop.ts — Act on a `/stop` comment: remove it, and post the request the
 * running job polls for.
 *
 * ## Why the request is a comment
 *
 * Nothing outside a workflow job can reach into that job's filesystem, so a stop has
 * to be left somewhere both sides can see. A comment is that place, and it is also
 * the record of who asked and when — a label would have needed a second thing to
 * carry the same information.
 *
 * The running job polls for `STOP_TAG` and, when it finds one newer than its own
 * start, writes the file `atoma run --stop-file` is watching. See `watch_for_stop.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the human's comment is deleted
 *
 * A stop must not become the next run's context. The whole point is that the run is
 * paused rather than told something; a `/stop` sitting in the session would be read
 * by the resumed agent as an instruction it has to account for.
 *
 * The notice this posts is tagged `llm-context=exclude`, so it is dropped by
 * `reconcile_github_session.ts` on the way into a session for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Why it says the comment was deleted
 *
 * Because the existing in-progress guard also deletes comments, and says so. Someone
 * whose `/stop` vanished with no explanation would have no way to tell "your stop is
 * being acted on" from "your comment was refused because a run is in progress".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   request_stop.ts --number N --comment-id ID --commenter LOGIN

/**
 * Sub-issues of `parent` that are currently claimed by an agent.
 *
 * A parent keeps the in-progress label for as long as its chain is running, and that
 * chain may be running on a sub-issue — so a `/stop` on the parent can be aimed at
 * the wrong number without anyone doing anything wrong. This does not stop them:
 * their sessions are separate, and stopping work somebody did not ask to stop is a
 * worse failure than naming it and letting them choose.
 *
 * Every failure here is silent. The stop request is the thing that matters and it has
 * already been posted; a list of candidates is an improvement to the notice, not a
 * precondition for it.
