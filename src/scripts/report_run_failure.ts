/**
 * report_run_failure.ts — Post the comment a failed run leaves behind.
 *
 * ## Why this is a script and not workflow bash
 *
 * It used to be a dozen `echo` lines building markdown inside a TypeScript
 * template literal that generates YAML that becomes bash. Every backtick in that
 * text crosses three layers of escaping, and the text now needs backticks: the
 * two things a person can do next are slash commands, and a slash command written
 * as plain prose reads as prose. Every other human-facing comment in this
 * repository is built here, tested here, and invoked in one line.
 *
 * ## What changed about what it says
 *
 * **The session now survives a failure**. Anyone who has used Atomaton
 * before will assume the opposite, so the notice says it outright and gives the
 * two ways forward — continue with the history, or archive it and start clean.
 * Which of those is right is a judgement about the work, and it belongs to the
 * person rather than to the machinery.
 *
 * ## Why the excerpt is last
 *
 * It is usually about the infrastructure — "MCP server closed connection",
 * "Unexpected while resolving package" — which no agent and often no person can
 * act on. It is kept because occasionally it is the answer, and put below the
 * part that always matters.
 *
 * Redacted before it becomes a comment: the log holds every MCP server's stderr,
 * and `unauthorized` is exactly the line a provider emits WITH the credential in
 * it. Actions masks registered secrets in the workflow log and does nothing for
 * an issue comment.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   report_run_failure.ts --number N --agent NAME [--notify LOGIN]
 *     --run-url URL [--logs-file FILE]
