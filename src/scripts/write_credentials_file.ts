/**
 * write_credentials_file.ts — collect this run's credentials into a JSON file for
 * `atoma run --credentials-file`.
 *
 * ## Why a file, and why this step exists at all
 *
 * A value in an environment block cannot be taken back. `/proc/<pid>/environ`
 * reflects what was placed on the stack at `execve`, and `unsetenv` does not
 * rewrite it — so anything that was ever in a process's environment stays
 * readable there, by any process of the same user, for that process's lifetime.
 *
 * The "Run agent" step's bash lives for the whole of `atoma run`. Giving it the
 * credentials therefore leaves them readable from `/proc` for minutes, to every
 * tool server the agent starts. Writing them here instead means only THIS step's
 * bash ever holds them, and it exits before the agent begins.
 *
 * atoma reads the file and deletes it before starting any tool server, so the
 * file and the servers never coexist. From then on the values are in atoma's
 * heap, which is out of reach: it makes itself non-dumpable.
 *
 * ## What goes in
 *
 * The credentials atoma itself needs (the provider key), the GitHub token the
 * `github`/`search`/`atoma` servers authenticate with, and whatever this project
 * declared in `tools.secrets`. Nothing else — this is not a dump of the
 * environment.
 *
 * Empty values are omitted rather than written as `""`. An unset repository
 * secret arrives as an empty string, and a present-but-empty key would tell
 * atoma's provider detection that a provider is configured when it is not.
 *
 * ## Where
 *
 * `$RUNNER_TEMP`, which is outside the workspace, so the checkout cannot have
 * placed a file there and nothing commits it by accident. tmpfs (`/dev/shm`)
 * would additionally keep the value off persistent storage, which is what
 * Kubernetes does for the same reason; that is worth measuring on a runner before
 * relying on it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   write_credentials_file.ts --out "$RUNNER_TEMP/atomaton-credentials.json"
