/**
 * prune_atoma_data.ts — remove the scratch a finished issue left behind.
 *
 * See `domain/atoma-data-pruning.ts` for why the rule is the issue's state rather than
 * an age, and what is deliberately left alone. This file is the part that talks to
 * GitHub and to git.
 *
 * Runs when an issue closes -- that is when its stored files become dead, so the
 * trigger and the condition are the same event and no schedule has to approximate it.
 * Anything one run misses is taken by the next issue to close.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   prune_atoma_data.ts [--repo OWNER/REPO] [--dry-run]
 *
 * `--dry-run` prints what it would delete and touches nothing, which is how to look at
 * a store before letting this loose on it.
 *
 * ## Why deleting files rather than rewriting history
 *
 * The history is where the bytes are, and only a force-push reclaims them. That is
 * exactly what must not happen here: sessions are written by runs that are going on
 * right now, from jobs that fetched this branch minutes ago, and a rewritten history
 * turns their next push into a conflict they have no handling for. So this removes
 * files and leaves the history, which keeps the working tree bounded and lets the
 * history grow slowly. Reclaiming it is a separate decision nobody has had to make yet.
