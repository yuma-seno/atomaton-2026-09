/**
 * read_secret_names.ts — publishes, as a step output, which repository secrets
 * this project's configuration lets one destination reach.
 *
 * The output feeds a computed-key lookup in a later step's `env:`
 * (`secrets[fromJSON(steps.<id>.outputs.names)[i]]`), which is what lets a
 * project add a credential without editing generated workflow YAML. See
 * domain/declared-secrets.ts for why it is shaped that way and what was measured
 * before relying on it.
 *
 * ## Why this reads a file it is handed, and not the checkout
 *
 * Every other script here reads `.github/atoma/config.yaml` through
 * `lib/config.ts`, which resolves it against the working tree. This one must
 * not. On a pull request run the working tree is the pull request's own head --
 * `atoma-runner.yml` checks out `refs/pull/N/head` -- so reading the declaration
 * from there would let a pull request decide which of the repository's secrets
 * are handed to the run reviewing it. The governance gate does not help: it
 * blocks the merge, and the run happens before the merge.
 *
 * The caller materialises the DEFAULT BRANCH's config.yaml and passes its path.
 * The distinction is deliberate and worth keeping straight: what a run *does*
 * comes from the branch under test, and what a run *may reach* comes from the
 * branch a person already approved.
 *
 * ## Failure behaviour
 *
 * No `--config`, or a file that cannot be read, declares nothing and says so.
 * Both fail closed: the run continues with no credentials rather than stopping,
 * and never falls back to the working tree, which is the thing a pull request
 * controls.
 *
 * `--config` is deliberately NOT required, though the workflow always passes it.
 * Requiring it made a deployment break itself: a deploy pull request is reviewed
 * by a run whose workflow YAML comes from the base branch and whose scripts come
 * from the pull request, so the release that first passed `--config` met the
 * previous release's workflow, which did not, and exited 2. A missing argument
 * is a degradation worth logging, not one worth failing a run over — and
 * `generated-workflows.test.ts` pins the workflow side, so it cannot be dropped
 * there without CI saying so.
 *
 * An unusable declaration does fail the run. Delivering the names that happen to
 * be valid turns a typo into a failure much later, somewhere that points nowhere
 * near the cause.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   read_secret_names.ts --destination tools|checks|deploy [--config <path>]
