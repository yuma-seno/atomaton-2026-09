/**
 * The script end to end: a real `atoma-data` to read, a fake `gh` to answer about the
 * issues, and `--dry-run` so nothing is pushed.
 *
 * A unit test of `domain/atoma-data-pruning.ts` checks the decision and can never see
 * what this does — whether the file asks GitHub the right question at all. It exists
 * because it did not. `ghPaginated` takes the argv of a `gh` call and the first word has
 * to be `api`; the first version omitted it and every run died with
 * `unknown command "repos/…"`. Typecheck cannot see a wrong string in a variadic
 * `...string[]`, and the failure only appeared when an issue was closed in production.
 *
 * The repository is built here rather than borrowed from the checkout, because a test
 * that reads the real `atoma-data` would depend on what that branch happens to hold and
 * on the network being there.
