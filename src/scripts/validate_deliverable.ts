/**
 * validate_deliverable.ts — checks that a tree's `.github/atoma/` is internally
 * consistent, before a pull request that changes it can merge.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * Nothing checked the deliverable's own consistency at pull-request time. Atoma
 * resolves every name in an agent's `mcp_servers` against tools.yaml and aborts
 * the whole run before a single MCP server starts if one is missing — so that
 * failure surfaced AFTER the merge, on whoever triggered the next run, rather
 * than as a red check on the pull request that introduced it.
 *
 * `tests/contract/agent-definitions.test.ts` does check that one rule, but
 * adopters never receive it: `build-dist.ts` excludes `*.test.ts` by design. And
 * `config.yaml`'s `checks.atoma_runs.commands` ships empty, so an adopter's `atoma-check.yml`
 * runs nothing at all until they configure it — and whatever they put there is
 * their pipeline, not a place to hide this.
 *
 * ## Two owners, no reimplementation
 *
 * Agent definitions and tools.yaml are the core's formats, and the core already
 * validates them: `atoma validate --agent-def X.md --tools-file tools.yaml` checks
 * the parse, `mcp_servers` against the tools file, `knows_about` targets and their
 * `extra_body` reserved keys, and the hook paths the tools file
 * names — with the same code a run uses. This calls it once per agent definition
 * instead of parsing YAML again in TypeScript.
 *
 * config.yaml is delivery's own format and the core has never heard of it. That
 * half is `domain/deliverable-integrity.ts`, which likewise writes no new
 * validator: it runs the four resolvers that already exist, at pull-request time
 * instead of at merge, deploy or credential-handout time.
 *
 * ## Which tree
 *
 * `--root` is the tree to validate, and on a pull request it is a checkout of the
 * pull request's HEAD — the content that would merge. This script itself comes
 * from the default branch. The pull request's `.github/atoma/` is data here and
 * never code: nothing under `--root` is executed, and the atoma binary is
 * downloaded by the workflow rather than taken from the tree being checked.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   validate_deliverable.ts [--root .] [--atoma atoma] [--report FILE]
 *
 * Exit codes are three-valued because the caller has to tell two failures apart:
 *
 *   0  the deliverable is consistent
 *   1  problems found — they are printed, and written to `--report` if given
 *   2  the check could not be performed (no such root, atoma would not run)
 *
 * `atoma-validate-pr.yml` treats 1 as a red check handed back to the engineer and
 * 2 as a broken job, because a validation that did not happen must not read as one
 * that passed. Run by hand — `bun run .github/scripts/validate_deliverable.ts` —
 * it is the same check the pull request is judged by.
