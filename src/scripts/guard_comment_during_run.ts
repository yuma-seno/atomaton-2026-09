/**
 * guard_comment_during_run.ts — While an issue/PR carries the configured
 * "in_progress" label (an Atomaton agent run is currently active on it), a new
 * human comment would otherwise sit unseen until the current run finishes
 * (or worse, race a slash-command dispatch against the in-flight run).
 * Instead: delete the comment immediately and notify its author via mention
 * so they know to wait and re-comment once the run concludes. No-ops
 * quietly (leaves the comment alone) when the label isn't present.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   guard_comment_during_run.ts --number N --comment-id ID --commenter LOGIN
 * Writes `blocked=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT.
