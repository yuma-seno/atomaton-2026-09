/**
 * run_deploy.ts — work out which of config.yaml's `deploy.atoma_runs.targets`
 * this run is for, and run their commands.
 *
 * This is the body of `atoma-deploy.yml`. Selection happens here rather than in
 * the workflow's `on:` because `on:` takes no expression: a tag pattern that an
 * agent can edit cannot live there. The workflow listens for every tag and this
 * decides whether any target wanted it.
 *
 * How a run is selected, in order:
 *
 *   --target NAME    one named target, whatever its trigger. A name that matches
 *                    nothing fails, rather than falling back to something the
 *                    caller did not ask for.
 *   --trigger merge  every `on: merge` target. `dispatchCd` sends this after an
 *                    agent's merge, which uses GITHUB_TOKEN and so fires no
 *                    `push` for anything to catch.
 *   --trigger manual nothing. Someone dispatched by hand without naming a
 *                    target, and guessing which one they meant is worse than
 *                    telling them nothing happened.
 *   a pushed tag     every `on: tag` target whose pattern claims it.
 *   a pushed branch  every `on: merge` target. A person's merge does fire `push`,
 *                    and the workflow only listens on the default branch, so a
 *                    branch ref arriving here means a change landed there. Before
 *                    this, `on: merge` fired for an agent's merge and silently
 *                    not for a person's.
 *
 * Matching nothing is a clean exit, not a failure. A repository tags things for
 * reasons that have nothing to do with deploying, and a red run for each one
 * teaches people to ignore the red.
 *
 * Each target's commands run in order and the first failure ends the run with
 * its exit code. Later targets do not run: with one deployment already broken,
 * continuing puts more of the estate in an unknown state rather than less.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   run_deploy.ts --ref refs/tags/v1.0.0 [--trigger merge|manual] [--target production]
