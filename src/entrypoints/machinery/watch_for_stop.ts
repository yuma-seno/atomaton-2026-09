/**
 * watch_for_stop.ts — Poll an issue/PR for a stop request and, when one arrives,
 * create the file `atoma run --stop-file` is watching.
 *
 * Runs in the background for the length of the agent step and is killed with it.
 *
 * ## Why polling
 *
 * A stop is decided outside the job, and nothing outside a job can write into that
 * job's filesystem. Something inside has to go and look. GitHub has no push channel
 * a running job can subscribe to, so this is the only shape available, and its cost
 * is one API request per interval — around 110 for a full-length run.
 *
 * ## Why it only looks at requests newer than the run
 *
 * A stop from last week is not a stop of this run. Without the cutoff, an issue that
 * was ever stopped could never be worked on again: every run would find the old
 * request on its first poll and stop before doing anything.
 *
 * ## Why it never fails the step
 *
 * It is a background process inside the step that runs the agent. Exiting non-zero
 * would say the run failed, and "GitHub returned a 502 while we were polling" is not
 * a failed run. A poll that cannot answer is treated as "no stop yet", which is the
 * answer that lets work continue.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   watch_for_stop.ts --number N --stop-file PATH --since ISO8601 [--interval-seconds N]
