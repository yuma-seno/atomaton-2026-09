/**
 * decide_guard_release.ts — computes, via the pure domain rule in
 * domain/work/serialization-guard.ts, whether the atomaton/in-progress
 * SerializationGuard should be released after this run, and writes
 * `should_release=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT for the "Remove
 * atomaton/in-progress label" step's `if:` to consume.
 *
 * This step must run with `if: always()` in the workflow (see
 * atomaton-runner.wac.ts) so the decision is computed even when the agent run
 * itself failed or was skipped entirely -- shouldReleaseGuard()'s own rule
 * 1 handles that case (any non-'success' outcome releases the guard).
 * `--outcome` is expected to carry GitHub Actions' own `steps.atoma.outcome`
 * value directly ("success" | "failure" | "cancelled" | "skipped").
 *
 * IMPORTANT: unlike most scripts in this repo, this one deliberately does
 * NOT hard-fail (process.exit) on a missing/empty `--outcome`. This script
 * always runs under `always()`, and its entire purpose is to decide whether
 * a lock (the in-progress label) gets released -- exiting before writing
 * `should_release` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT would leave the downstream "Remove
 * label" step's condition evaluating against an empty/undefined output
 * (false), silently leaving the label stuck FOREVER with no error surfaced
 * anywhere. A missing/empty/unrecognized outcome is instead treated the
 * same as any other non-'success' outcome -- `succeeded` becomes false,
 * which shouldReleaseGuard()'s own rule 1 already resolves to "release" --
 * matching what the original inline bash expression
 * (`steps.atoma.outcome != 'success'`) would also have done for an empty
 * string. Fail toward releasing the guard, never toward holding it stuck.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   decide_guard_release.ts --outcome success
 *     [--limit-reached true] [--stop-requested true] [--loop-limit-reached true]
 *     [--chain-continues true] [--directive AGENT_NAME]
