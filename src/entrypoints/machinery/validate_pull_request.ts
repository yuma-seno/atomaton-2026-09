/**
 * validate_pull_request.ts — runs the repository's CI against an agent's pull
 * request, writes the result where the branch ruleset will look for it, and says
 * who works next.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * An agent's pull request cannot satisfy a required status check on its own.
 *
 * GitHub changed on 2026-06-11 ("Bot-created pull requests can run workflows if
 * approved"): a workflow triggered by a pull request that the default
 * `GITHUB_TOKEN` created or updated is held for human approval, even on a branch
 * in the same repository. The intent is that generated code should not
 * automatically run workflows that may reach secrets. No setting disables it.
 *
 * So the run that would normally produce the required check sits at
 * `action_required` and never reports. This script dispatches CI itself, waits
 * for it, and republishes its conclusion as a check run the ruleset accepts.
 *
 * ## Two things here look like redundancy and are not
 *
 * **The mirrored check is not a duplicate of the dispatched run's own check.**
 * Both carry the same name on the same commit. Only the mirror satisfies the
 * ruleset: a check derived from a `workflow_dispatch` run does not count toward a
 * required status check, while one created through the Checks API does. Measured
 * with every confounder removed — a human-opened pull request, a fresh commit, no
 * held run, nothing deleted, a successful check on the head commit, still
 * blocked. Delete the mirror and agent pull requests stop merging.
 *
 * **The held `action_required` run must be left alone.** Every agent pull request
 * carries one, it shows as a pending check, and deleting it is the obvious
 * cleanup. Doing so destroys the commit's check rollup permanently: REST goes on
 * reporting the check runs and suites as successful and associated with the pull
 * request while GraphQL reports `statusCheckRollup: null`, and re-running CI does
 * not repair it, because the damage is to the commit rather than to any run.
 * Left in place it is harmless — with the mirror present the pull request reaches
 * `UNSTABLE`, which the ruleset permits.
 *
 * ## Why the waiting happens here rather than in an agent
 *
 * Nothing wakes an agent when CI finishes. A completed run fires `workflow_run`
 * only when the originating event came from something other than `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
 * and neither a bot's `pull_request` (even after approval) nor a
 * `workflow_dispatch` qualifies — the documented `workflow_dispatch` exemption
 * covers creating a run, not its completion. Agents also have no sleep.
 *
 * A workflow job can wait, because a loop inside a live job is not a new trigger.
 * That is the whole reason this sequencing lives in a script the runner calls.
 *
 * ## If GitHub closes this
 *
 * The mechanism is sanctioned — Checks API check runs are how third-party CI
 * reports into a pull request, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` satisfies the app-only
 * restriction because it is an installation token for the github-actions app. The
 * purpose is not: it satisfies a required check for code GitHub held back. The
 * narrowest closure would stop `GITHUB_TOKEN` creating check runs on a commit
 * whose pull request `GITHUB_TOKEN` opened, which would leave third-party CI
 * intact.
 *
 * Two retreats, each giving up something this design keeps:
 *
 * - Drop the required check from the ruleset. Merging then needs only a pull
 *   request, and whether CI passed becomes the reviewer's judgement rather than a
 *   server-side rule — one ruleset no longer governs humans and agents alike.
 * - Give the agent a trusted identity, a GitHub App or a personal access token,
 *   for opening and pushing to the pull request. Nothing is held, so nothing needs
 *   mirroring and no human acts — at the cost of an adoption step, and of
 *   attributing the agent's commits to whoever owns the token.
 *
 * ## The deliverable is checked before CI is asked to run
 *
 * `--deliverable-report` names the file `validate_deliverable.ts` wrote for this
 * pull request. A non-empty one means the pull request would merge a
 * `.github/atomaton/` that cannot start a run, and this script then writes the failing
 * checks and hands it back WITHOUT dispatching CI — there is nothing to learn from
 * running a pipeline against a deliverable that cannot be loaded.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   validate_pull_request.ts --repo owner/name --number N --branch atomaton/issue-N
 *     --workflow ci.yml --reviewer reviewer --engineer engineer
 *     --deliverable-report FILE [--timeout-seconds 1800]
