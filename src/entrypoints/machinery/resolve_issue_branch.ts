/**
 * resolve_issue_branch.ts — says which branch a run should check out, if any.
 *
 * Branches are created when work is committed, not when a run starts. Most runs
 * never commit: a run that reports a CI failure, confirms a merge, or closes an
 * issue produces no code. Creating a branch for those left one behind per run,
 * and the repository had accumulated 72 of them.
 *
 * Deciding by what a run does rather than by which agent it is matters. Agents
 * are the adopter's to edit, rename and add to, so nothing here may key off an
 * agent's name — a branch appears when something is committed, whoever committed
 * it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   resolve_issue_branch.ts --repo owner/name --issue 12
 *
 * Writes `branch=<name-or-empty>` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Empty means start from the
 * base branch; `commit_and_push` names a new branch if the run turns out to need
 * one.
