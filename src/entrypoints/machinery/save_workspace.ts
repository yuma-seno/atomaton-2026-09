/**
 * save_workspace.ts — persist the working files the agent left behind.
 *
 * Runs after the agent, and takes the root issue from the restore step's output
 * rather than resolving the chain again. Resolving twice invites the two answers
 * disagreeing -- a parent tag edited mid-run would have this write to a different
 * workspace than the one the agent read from, and nothing would say so.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   save_workspace.ts --root-issue N --source /tmp/atomaton-workspace [--agent NAME]
 *
 * Best effort. A failure costs the next run its notes, and must not cost this run
 * its result -- the work is already committed and the report already posted by the
 * time this runs. It says so and exits 0.
