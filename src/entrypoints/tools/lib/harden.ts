/**
 * harden.ts — what a tool server that holds a credential does to itself at startup.
 *
 * Two things, and both exist because every tool server now runs as ONE dedicated
 * OS user. That arrangement is what gives every tool the same environment,
 * and it is also what makes these two necessary: same user means the shell server
 * is a peer, not a stranger.
 *
 * ## 1. Become unreadable
 *
 * `/proc/<pid>/environ` is readable between processes of one user. Measured on
 * `ubuntu-latest`: a peer process reads the value out of a holder's environment
 * block, plainly. `prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)` makes the kernel own that entry
 * root and refuse the read — measured, with the credential still in the
 * environment block and still readable BY THIS PROCESS. It locks the door from
 * outside, not the value.
 *
 * atoma does this for itself, which is why the provider API key was never at
 * risk. It does not carry to a child: the flag is reset on `execve`, also
 * measured, so it cannot be set for a server by whatever launches it. The server
 * has to call it, here.
 *
 * The one cost: no debugger, `strace` or `perf` attaches to this process as the
 * same user any more. That needs `sudo`, and the user these run as does not have
 * it — so debugging a server means running it by hand.
 *
 * ## 2. Narrow PATH
 *
 * See `domain/machinery/tool-hardening.ts`. Briefly: three directories on the runner's PATH
 * are world-writable, so a peer can put a file called `gh` in one and the server
 * that looks `gh` up hands it the token. Nothing is read; the credential is
 * delivered.
 *
 * ## What this does not close
 *
 * A child process. `gh` is a statically linked Go binary, so `LD_PRELOAD` cannot
 * make it non-dumpable, and the flag does not survive its `execve` either — so
 * while `gh` runs, GH_TOKEN is in a readable environment block. That exposure is
 * accepted rather than fixed: GH_TOKEN expires with the job, the agent can
 * already use it through the github tools, and `actions/checkout` leaves the same
 * value in `.git/config` inside the work tree.
 *
 * A third-party server. It will not call this, and nothing can call it on its
 * behalf. See docs/tools/boundaries.md, "What a tool can and cannot be
 * protected from".

 * What a PATH entry is, as far as this process can tell.
 *
 * Three answers rather than two, because the first real run of this reported four
 * directories as "writable" that it had only failed to stat -- `node_modules/.bin`
 * paths that do not exist, and `/home/runner/.local/bin`, whose parent this user
 * cannot traverse. Dropping those is harmless: a directory this process cannot
 * inspect is one it cannot execute from either. Calling them writable is not.
 *
 * The distinction is worth the third case because this produces a security-shaped
 * log line, and a reader will take it at face value.
