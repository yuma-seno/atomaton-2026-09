 * Dependencies: `gh` CLI + `git`.
 *
 * Every mutation is logged to $ATOMA_OPS_LOG (see lib/ops-log.ts) as a
 * general audit trail; dispatch decisions specifically are also what
 * atoma-runner.wac.ts's chain_continues detection reads.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this process's `process.stdout` IS the JSON-RPC transport --

 * in-process (resolveNotify/dispatchOrchestratorIfSubIssueReady/etc.);
 * always `console.error()` (`log()` below) for logging.
