/**
 * mcp-tool.ts — the one place a tool is defined, and the one place a server is
 * run.
 *
 * Two halves of the same idea. `defineMcpTool` makes a tool's arguments have a
 * single definition; `serveMcpServer` makes a tool's *result* have one. Both
 * exist because the alternative was five files each writing out its own version
 * and drifting.
 *
 * ## The argument half
 *
 * Before this, every MCP tool in mcp/github.ts and mcp/atomaton.ts had TWO
 * independent, hand-written descriptions of its own arguments: a JSON
 * Schema literal (the `inputSchema` sent to the LLM) and a handler body
 * full of unchecked `a.title as string` casts on a bare
 * `Record<string, unknown>`. Nothing linked the two — a schema change and
 * a handler change could silently drift apart, and a malformed argument
 * from the LLM was only ever caught (if at all) deep inside a `gh` call.
 *
 * `defineMcpTool` closes that gap: a single Zod schema is both (a) compiled
 * to the JSON Schema advertised to the LLM, and (b) used to validate +
 * parse incoming arguments into a properly-typed object before the handler
 * ever runs. A malformed call is now rejected up front with a readable
 * "field: reason" message, and the handler's argument type is inferred
 * directly from the schema — no casts possible.
 *
 * NOTE: imports from "zod/v3", not "zod". zod-to-json-schema (as installed)
 * only recognizes schemas built from the classic v3 constructor internals;
 * schemas built via the bare "zod" entrypoint round-trip fine through
 * `.parse()`/`.safeParse()` but silently produce an empty `{}` JSON Schema
 * when passed to `zodToJsonSchema()`. Confirmed by direct probing during
 * implementation — always import `z` from "zod/v3" in files that build
 * MCP tool schemas.
 *
 * ## The result half
 *
 * See `serveMcpServer` at the bottom. In short: every server hand-wrote the
 * ~10-line `CallToolRequestSchema` handler that maps a result into MCP content,
 * and each dropped a different field of it.

/**
 * Names a model reaches for when the schema says something else.
 *
 * Measured, not guessed. A verification run on a real runner produced three of
 * these in a row:
 *
 *   Tool error for get_issue: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'issue_number'
 *   Tool error for get_issue_comments: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'issue_number'
 *   Tool error for request_close_issue: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'issue_number'
 *
 * `issue_number` is what the GitHub REST API calls it, so a model has seen it far
 * more often than a bare `number`. Before schemas became strict, zod dropped the
 * unknown key and the defaulted `number` filled in from `ISSUE_NUMBER` — so these
 * calls silently worked, which is why nothing surfaced until strictness arrived.
 *
 * Strictness stays: it exists because a MISSPELLED key (`form` for `from`) turned
 * into a different call that succeeded, and that is a real defect. This is not
 * that. `issue_number` is not a typo for `number`, it is a synonym for it, and
 * accepting it changes nothing about what the call does.
 *
 * That is the distinction to hold on to. `positiveInt` and `stringArray` are the
 * same bargain — advertise the strict shape, be forgiving at run time about a
 * KNOWN confusion whose intent is unambiguous. It is the opposite of the APPROVE
 * case, where the runtime used to accept a value that could never work and taught
 * the model to keep asking for it.
 *
 * Generalised from `number` to a map after the same confusion turned up on a second
 * key. `get_branch` took `name` while `sync_branch`, sitting beside it in the same
 * catalog, took `branch` -- so an agent that had just synchronised a branch asked
 * about it with the key it had used a moment earlier and was refused. Two adjacent
 * tools naming one concept differently is the defect; accepting the synonym is the
 * repair that does not require every caller to know which is which.
