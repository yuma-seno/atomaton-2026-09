/**
 * mcp-tool.ts — the one place a tool is defined, and the one place a server is
 * run.
 *
 * Two halves of the same idea. `defineMcpTool` makes a tool's arguments have a
 * single definition; `serveMcpServer` makes a tool's *result* have one. Both
 * exist because the alternative was five files each writing out its own version
 * and drifting.
 *
 * ## The argument half
 *
 * Before this, every MCP tool in mcp/github.ts and mcp/atomaton.ts had TWO
 * independent, hand-written descriptions of its own arguments: a JSON
 * Schema literal (the `inputSchema` sent to the LLM) and a handler body
 * full of unchecked `a.title as string` casts on a bare
 * `Record<string, unknown>`. Nothing linked the two — a schema change and
 * a handler change could silently drift apart, and a malformed argument
 * from the LLM was only ever caught (if at all) deep inside a `gh` call.
 *
 * `defineMcpTool` closes that gap: a single Zod schema is both (a) compiled
 * to the JSON Schema advertised to the LLM, and (b) used to validate +
 * parse incoming arguments into a properly-typed object before the handler
 * ever runs. A malformed call is now rejected up front with a readable
 * "field: reason" message, and the handler's argument type is inferred
 * directly from the schema — no casts possible.
 *
 * NOTE: imports from "zod/v3", not "zod". zod-to-json-schema (as installed)
 * only recognizes schemas built from the classic v3 constructor internals;
 * schemas built via the bare "zod" entrypoint round-trip fine through
 * `.parse()`/`.safeParse()` but silently produce an empty `{}` JSON Schema
 * when passed to `zodToJsonSchema()`. Confirmed by direct probing during
 * implementation — always import `z` from "zod/v3" in files that build
 * MCP tool schemas.
 *
 * ## The result half
 *
 * See `serveMcpServer` at the bottom. In short: every server hand-wrote the
 * ~10-line `CallToolRequestSchema` handler that maps a result into MCP content,
 * and each dropped a different field of it.

// `ALIASES`, `declaredKeys` and `acceptAliases` were here: a table folding four

// could see the call.
//
// It was the wrong half of the repair. Only ONE of the five was ever observed --
// `issue_number`, three times in one run -- and the other four were speculative,
// which this file's own comment forbade in the same breath as adding them: "a
// speculative synonym is indistinguishable from a typo, and quietly accepting a
// typo is the defect strictness exists to prevent". Worse, `branch: ["name"]` was
// added by the very commit that renamed `get_branch`'s argument to `branch`, so
// there was never an older deployed shape to be compatible with; and because
// `sync_branch`'s `branch` is OPTIONAL, `sync_branch({name: ...})` was not refused
// but silently understood as a branch to synchronise.
//
// The cause was diagnosed and fixed elsewhere while the tolerance stayed: the
// Responses adapter had been sending no MCP schemas at all, so the model was
// inferring argument shapes from names in the system prompt -- exactly the shape of
// these failures. See `src/workflows/actions/atoma-cli.ts`.
//
// So the tools name their arguments the way a model reaches for them --
// `issue_number` on an issue tool, `pull_number` on a pull request one, `branch` on
// both branch tools -- and there are no synonyms. `refuseUnknownKeys` is the whole
// mechanism now, which is what it was written to be.
