 * rather than a directory on PATH because PATH does not work for this on Windows: a
 * bare command resolves through PATHEXT, so the fake has to carry an extension, and
 * the only extensions Windows will run are a compiled `.exe` or a `.cmd` — which
 * Bun and Node refuse to pass arguments containing `"` or `|` to, on purpose, since
 * cmd.exe would re-parse them. Half this repository's `gh` calls carry a jq
 * expression, so a `.cmd` shim rejects them.
 *
 * The fake was on PATH, and on Windows it was silently never used: what ran was the
 * real `gh`, with the developer's own credentials, against this repository. This
 * removes the resolution step that made that possible rather than fixing it, because
 * the failure mode of getting it wrong is writing to a live repository.
 *
 * Named for what it is. This is a test seam and nothing else: it takes a script, run by
 * the runtime already running, so it cannot be mistaken for configuration naming where
 * a real installation keeps its CLI.
