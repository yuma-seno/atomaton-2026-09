 * There were three, and they disagreed. `branch-placement.ts` read the body's
 * `atoma:parent` tag; `aggregation.ts` read the same tag through its own copy of
 * the same `gh` call; `scripts/resolve_orchestrator_parent.ts` issued its own
 * GraphQL query for GitHub's native sub-issue `parent` field and fell back to the
 * tag. Nothing recorded why one of the three had the richer rule.
 *
 * The richer rule is the right one and is now everyone's. GitHub's own parent
 * link is authoritative when it exists, and the tag is what Atomaton writes itself
 * -- an issue created by `create_issue` carries the tag whether or not the native
 * link was established, and `addSubIssue` is best-effort.
 *
 * Not `issueLinks`, which answers a much larger question: it pulls fifty children
 * and fifty pull requests, and every caller here wants one number.
