 * The remote branches that could belong to this issue, each marked with whether

 *
 * Scoped to one issue rather than listing every `atomaton/issue-*` branch, because
 * the merged flag has to be asked for per branch and a repository accumulates
 * hundreds. `atomaton/issue-12` also matches `atomaton/issue-120` here; separating
 * them is `domain/issue-branch.ts`'s job, and over-collecting is the safe
 * direction.
 *
 * Merged is read from the pull requests rather than from git ancestry: a squash
 * merge leaves no ancestry to follow, so a branch whose work is in the base
 * would still look unmerged — and a run that believed that would resume a branch
 * whose commits are already released.
 *
 * Returns what it managed to learn rather than throwing. A caller that cannot
 * list branches should start from the base branch, not stop the run.
