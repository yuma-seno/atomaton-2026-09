/**
 * The branch a sub-issue's work should be cut from, or "" for the base branch.
 *
 * Sub-issues of one parent are split from a single piece of work and usually
 * depend on each other — an interface one defines is what the next one consumes.
 * Cutting each from the base hides those from one another until every part has
 * landed separately, which is where integration surprises come from.
 *
 * So they stack: each is cut from the parent's branch and merges back into it,
 * and the parent's branch reaches the base as one reviewed change. The parent's
 * branch is created here, empty, if the first child gets there first — an
 * orchestrator plans and dispatches without committing, so its branch would
 * otherwise not exist yet.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout. Every failure returns "" and the work is cut from the
 * base, which is the behaviour before stacking existed: a slower integration is
 * not worth failing a commit over.
