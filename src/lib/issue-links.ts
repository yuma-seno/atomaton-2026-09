/**
 * issue-links.ts — reads an issue's relationships out of GitHub.
 *
 * One GraphQL request per issue covers all of it: the parent and children come
 * from GitHub's sub-issues, which `create_issue` establishes through
 * `addSubIssue` and which a person gets for free by using the sub-issue control
 * in the web UI; the pull requests come from two places that have to be unioned,
 * for the reason `claimsToClose` explains.
 *
 * Nothing here reads an Atomaton marker. The relationships have to survive an
 * issue a person opened, decomposed and closed without an agent ever touching
 * it, and markers only exist where an agent has been.
