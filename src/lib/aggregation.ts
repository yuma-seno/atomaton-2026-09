/**
 * aggregation.ts — the ONE canonical implementation of "check whether all
 * sub-issues of an orchestrated parent are done, and if so, dispatch the
 * orchestrator for re-invocation".
 *
 * Three call sites need this exact gate, previously reimplemented
 * independently with subtly different retry/exclude/idempotency behavior:
 *
 * - `dispatchOrchestratorIfSubIssueReady` below, reached from the MCP server
 *   whenever an agent closes a sub-issue (atomaton-side, post-close).
 * - dispatch_if_siblings_done.ts (workflow-side, manual-close fallback).
 * - aggregate_sub_issues.ts (workflow-side, PR-merge primary path -- which
 *   additionally injects sub-issue results into the orchestrator's session
 *   before dispatching, via `beforeDispatch` below).
 *
 * Idempotency: two of the three can race for the SAME completion -- a PR merge
 * triggers the event-driven aggregate_sub_issues.ts AND, asynchronously, an
 * origin-agent re-invocation that eventually closes the sub-issue itself and
 * reaches the first path. The `atoma:aggregated` marker check below makes
 * whichever caller gets here first win and the other a no-op.
