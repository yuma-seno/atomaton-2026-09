/**
 * ops-log.ts — Structured JSON-lines log of mutating operations Atomaton
 * performs during a run, written to $ATOMATON_OPS_LOG (default
 * /tmp/atomaton_ops.log). Two purposes:
 *   1. A general audit trail (create_issue, close_issue, create_pr,
 *      merge_pr, etc. -- see mcp/github.ts's call sites).
 *   2. `logDispatch()`'s `"op":"dispatch"` entries are the canonical,
 *      STRUCTURED signal `atoma-runner.wac.ts`'s `chain_continues`
 *      detection reads (via `grep` for the literal `"op":"dispatch"`
 *      JSON key/value, a stable documented field -- not by pattern-matching
 *      arbitrary human-readable log prose). The previous approach (grepping
 *      stderr log TEXT for hand-written strings like "dispatched: agent=...")
 *      silently broke once already when a refactor changed the wording
 *      without updating the grep pattern to match -- this module exists so
 *      that class of bug can't recur: the dispatch signal now has one
 *      canonical writer and one canonical reader, both referring to the
 *      same `"op":"dispatch"` literal.
