/**
 * branch-rules.ts — what a branch's protection requires, and whether that answer
 * could be determined at all.
 *
 * One reader, because there are two callers and they are the two halves of one
 * contract. `validate_pull_request.ts` writes a Checks API check run for each
 * context this returns; `merge-readiness.ts` then blocks the merge for each
 * context this returns that has no passing run. If the two lists ever differ,
 * the mirror writes the wrong set and the pull request is blocked on a check
 * nothing will ever create — silently, since a duplicated reader would degrade
 * to an empty list on both sides.
 *
 * ## Why the result says whether it is known
 *
 * The previous readers returned `string[]` and used `[]` for four different
 * situations: the branch has no rule, the API call failed, the response did not
 * parse, and no base ref was given. Only the first of those means "nothing is
 * required". The rest mean "this could not be determined", and collapsing them
 * cost a real guarantee: `passed = checks.every(...)` is `true` for an empty
 * list, so a failed read reported a **failing** run as passed, which suppressed
 * the failure comment, which is also the retry tally, so the retry limit that
 * bounds the engineer/CI loop could never fire.
 *
 * Returning the distinction makes each caller answer for itself what an unknown
 * means, which is the only place that question can be answered honestly.

/**
 * GitHub's answer when branch rules are not a feature this repository has.
 *
 * Rulesets and branch protection are paid features on a private repository, so a free
 * account gets 403 with this message for every branch. That is a DEFINITE answer --
 * no rule can be required here -- and it is not the same as a read that failed, which
 * is why it gets its own state below rather than being folded into either.
 *
 * Matched on GitHub's wording, which is the only signal the response carries: the
 * status is a plain 403, indistinguishable from a token that lacks the scope. If the
 * wording ever changes this stops matching and the answer falls back to "could not be
 * read", which is the safe direction -- a caller then refuses instead of assuming.
