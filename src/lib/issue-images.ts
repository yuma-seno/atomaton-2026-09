 * is shown its address, which is the one thing it cannot follow.

 * atoma's LLM adapters already know how to place — the same shape a tool uses
 * when it returns one.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout. An image that cannot be fetched leaves its markdown
 * in the text, which is what the run had before.
