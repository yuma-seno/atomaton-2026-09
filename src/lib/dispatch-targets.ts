/**
 * dispatch-targets.ts — the workflows an agent's own actions have to start.
 *
 * All four exist for one reason: GitHub starts no workflow run for events its
 * own token triggers. An agent opening a pull request fires no
 * `pull_request.opened`; an agent merging fires no `push`. So anything that
 * would have chained off those events has to be dispatched explicitly, and
 * `workflow_dispatch` is the documented exception that still runs.
 *
 * Every one is best-effort. A dispatch that fails must not fail the action that
 * prompted it — a pull request that exists without its CI started is recoverable,
 * one that was never created is not.

/**
 * Run CI on a pull request, and hand it to `reviewer` afterwards if one is named.
 *
 * Validation rather than a reviewer directly: the reviewer used to be dispatched
 * from here and arrived before CI had a verdict, so it either reported that it
 * would wait -- with nothing able to wake it -- or merged without one. Validation
 * runs CI first and dispatches what the result calls for: the reviewer when it
 * passes, the engineer when it does not. See `scripts/validate_pull_request.ts`.
 *
 * Returns whether the dispatch was sent. `create_pr` ends the engineer's session
 * on success, so nothing is left running to notice a failure here: the pull request
 * would sit with no CI, no required check and no agent scheduled, while the tool
 * reported success. The caller keeps the session open instead.
 *
 * The name is a parameter now. It used to come from
 * `getTriggerAgent("pull_request.opened", "reviewer")` -- reading which agent an
 * `auto_triggers` entry routed that event to (that setting is gone), and falling back to the literal
 * `"reviewer"`.
 *
 * That coupling was invisible from either end. The trigger fired only for a
 * HUMAN's pull request, because GitHub starts no workflow run for an event its own
 * token caused, so an agent's pull request reached its reviewer through THIS call
 * while a person's reached it through the trigger. Two halves of one behaviour,
 * each looking like the whole. Removing the trigger would silently have
 * moved every adopter who renamed their reviewer onto the literal fallback.
 *
 * An empty name means nothing is dispatched after CI, which the validate workflow
 * already handled: `next_agent` empty, the failing or passing check stands, and a
 * person picks it up. `create_pr` makes sure they are told.

 * merge, and this is the one trigger where the question can be answered before
 * starting anything. The tag trigger has no such luxury -- `on:` takes no expression
 * -- so that one filters after the fact.
 *
 * It asks the weaker of the two questions -- `mergeMightDeploy`, not
 * `selectDeployJobs` -- because it knows less than the run does: the config it reads
 * predates the merge it is reacting to, and the repository's default branch is not
 * visible from here. An entry that might apply counts as one that does.
