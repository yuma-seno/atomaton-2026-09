/**
 * dispatch.ts — start an agent run by dispatching the runner workflow.
 *
 * Four places hand work to another agent: an orchestrator launching sub-agents,
 * a created PR summoning its reviewer, a merged PR re-invoking the agent that
 * opened it, and the aggregation gate re-invoking an orchestrator once its
 * sub-issues are done. Each had built its own `gh workflow run` call, and the
 * copies had diverged in the two ways that matter.
 *
 * They disagreed on how the workflow is named -- `||`, `??`, a hardcoded
 * string, and a per-call option nothing ever passed.
 *
 * More seriously, two of them ignored the exit code and wrote the ops-log
 * dispatch entry unconditionally. That entry is not bookkeeping: it is the
 * signal `atomaton-runner`'s `chain_continues` output reads to decide whether work
 * is still in flight, and `shouldReleaseGuard` keeps the `atomaton/in-progress`
 * label held whenever it is set. So a dispatch that failed -- a bad token, a
 * renamed workflow, a rate limit -- reported a chain that had started when none
 * had, and left the issue locked with nothing on the way to unlock it.
 *
 * Binding the two together here is the point of this module: the ops-log entry
 * is written if and only if GitHub accepted the dispatch, and it cannot be
 * forgotten by the next call site added.
