/**
 * Types for `@huggingface/transformers`, declared rather than depended on.
 *
 * The package is not a build-time dependency and deliberately is not one: it is
 * excluded from the bundle (see build-dist.ts) and installed on the runner from
 * `mcp-packages.json`, because it reaches onnxruntime's native binaries and a
 * JavaScript bundler cannot carry those. Adding it to `package.json` would put a
 * 600MB install into every CI run to type-check two function signatures.
 *
 * So the shape is written here instead, covering only what `mcp/search.ts` uses.
 * If that file starts using more of the library, this grows with it — and if the
 * two ever disagree, the failure shows up at the first tool call rather than at
 * compile time. That is the trade being made, and it is the same trade the
 * bundle exclusion already forced.
