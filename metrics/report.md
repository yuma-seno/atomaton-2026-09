# Agent metrics

Read from 358 stored sessions on this branch. Nothing here is recorded specially: every number is something the agents already wrote down while working.

Generated 2026-09-13.

## Runs

| window | runs | gave up | median seconds | longest |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Last 7 days | 3 | 0% | 37 | 61 |
| Last 30 days | 3 | 0% | 37 | 61 |
| All time | 3 | 0% | 37 | 61 |

**Gave up** is every ending that is not `completed` — a ceiling reached, a person asking, a provider hanging up, a loop cut short. Each one is a mechanism deciding the run should not continue, which is worth watching whether or not it was right.

| ended because | runs |
| --- | ---: |
| `completed` | 3 |

## Tokens

116,224,046 tokens over 411 runs that reported them. **98.9% of that is prompt** — what the agents were made to read, not what they wrote. Anything spent on making runs cheaper belongs on that side.

No money here, deliberately: of the four providers only one reports a cost, and a price table goes quietly stale and then prints confident wrong numbers. Multiply by a rate you know.

## Sessions

| | p50 | p90 | p99 | max | total |

| `engineer` | 85 | 23.7% |
| `orchestrator` | 37 | 10.3% |

## Tools

Failure is counted by the result reading as an error, which is a string match and so an estimate. A high rate is worth looking at either way: it is either a tool that breaks or a tool the prompt points at wrongly.

### Servers never used

Every tool a server offers is described in the prompt of every run. These have never been called:

- `atoma_env`

## Shell activity

What the agents do when they reach for a shell. `search` without a matching `open` is the shape that produced this project's most expensive runs; `edit` against `verify` is the shape that turned out not to occur at all.

| act | calls | share |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `other` | 986 | 43.5% |
| `search` | 807 | 35.6% |
| `open` | 259 | 11.4% |
| `verify` | 149 | 6.6% |
| `edit` | 64 | 2.8% |

Hooks refused 175 calls.
