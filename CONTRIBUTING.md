## Source-of-truth map

Everything here divides into two kinds: **the deliverable**, which adopters
receive, and **this repository's own tooling**, which they must never see.

The deliverable:

- `src/`: hand-authored source for the template — agent definitions, skills, MCP
  servers, workflow definitions. Adopter-agnostic by rule: no reference to this
  repository's build pipeline, no incident history, no PR numbers.
- `dist/.github/`: generated from `src/` by `bun run synth`. This is what adopters
  receive. **Not tracked in git** — it is a pure function of `src/`, and the
  release deployment publishes it as a release asset rather than committing it.
- `scripts/`: this project's own pipeline. `release.sh` is what `deploy.atomaton_runs.targets`
  names, and they are the reason there are no hand-written workflows left.
  Governed, like `.github/`. The secret scan used to live here too and now ships to
  every adopter as `.github/atomaton-runtime/scripts/scan_secrets.ts`; this repository
  runs the shipped one, so a defect in it fails here before it reaches anybody else.

This repository's own:

- `self/`: the four files that are this repository's rather than the template's,
  laid out to mirror `.github/`. Nothing else in `.github/` is ours. See
  [Applying a release](#applying-a-release).
- top-level `.github/`: this repository's adoption of the deliverable. Exactly two
  sources, and nothing kept alive by remembering: a release archive, with `self/`
  copied over it. Upgraded deliberately rather than on merge — that lag is what
  stops a change to `src/` from reconfiguring the live agents the moment it
  merges. Adopters upgrade as a git-mediated merge instead, since they have tuned
  files to lose; see [docs/recipes.md](docs/recipes.md), "Move to a newer release".
- `tests/`: tests of the build-and-deploy machinery. Tests of *shipped behaviour*
  live beside the shipped code instead.
- `docs/`: adopter-facing documentation.

Nothing this repository needs for itself belongs under `src/`. That includes
tests of the pipeline, operational scripts, and any rule phrased in terms of
`dist/`, `synth`, or this repository's CI — adopters have none of those.

When changing template behavior, treat `src/` as canonical.

## Branch protection

What may reach `main` is declared in `.github/atomaton/rulesets/main.json`: no direct
pushes, no force-pushes, no branch deletion, and a pull request that cannot merge
until the `atomaton-check` job passes.

How an adopter applies that file, and the two settings they must get right, are in
[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md#5-if-you-use-a-branch-ruleset) — it is their work, not
a contributor's. What follows is this repository's own, and the reasoning behind
what the shipped file contains.

**The required context is a string, matched by hand.** `atomaton-check` is the job name
in `atomaton-check.yml`, and the two are joined by nothing else.
`generated-workflows.test.ts` holds the shipped pair together; this repository's copy
of the ruleset is applied by hand, so renaming either side means applying it again:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/{id} --input .github/atomaton/rulesets/main.json
```

**Nothing needs a bypass.** No workflow writes to `main` — the release deployment
attaches the deliverable to a release instead, which is why `dist/` is no longer
tracked. An agent merging a pull request needs no bypass either: it satisfies the
rules like anyone else.

That is deliberate, and it is what keeps the ruleset file self-contained. Granting a
bypass would mean naming either a GitHub App's ID or a deploy key — values that only
exist after manual setup elsewhere, so the reviewed declaration would stop describing
the whole configuration.

`bypass_actors` is present and empty rather than absent, so that the intent reads as
a decision rather than an omission. It once named the built-in GitHub Actions app,
which is not an app installable on a repository and therefore not a valid
`Integration` actor — the import failed with `The ruleset you are importing contains
an invalid actor`, and the entry was never applied at all.

**There is deliberately no workflow checking that the ruleset is in place.** A check
could only report, never enforce: if the ruleset were missing then `atomaton-check`
would no longer be a required context either, so a failing check would block nothing
— a permanently red mark that stops nobody, which is worse than no mark at all.

Nothing detects a ruleset edited in the UI without a matching change to the file, so
keeping the two together is a discipline rather than something enforced.

## Cutting a release

Bump `version` in `package.json` and merge it. That is the whole procedure.

The version is the single declaration, and `scripts/release.sh` derives the tag
from it, so there is no tag to push and nothing that can disagree. Releasing is an
ordinary reviewed change rather than a separate act of remembering.

That script is this project's one `deploy.atomaton_runs.targets` entry, declared `on: merge` in
`.github/atomaton/config.yaml`. It runs after every merge and is idempotent: it reads
the declared version, finds a release already exists for it, and stops before
installing anything. Only a merge that changes the version reaches the build,
where it packages `dist/` as `atomaton-delivery.zip` with `.github/` at the archive
root and creates the release — the tag included, via `--target`, so a tag never
exists without a release behind it.

Nothing writes to main, so none of this needs a ruleset bypass.

Both kinds of merge reach it, by different routes. Yours fires `push` on the
default branch, which `atomaton-deploy.yml` listens for. An agent's fires nothing —
GitHub starts no workflow run for events its own token triggers — so `mergePr`
dispatches the workflow explicitly.

To publish by hand, or to retry a failed run:

```bash
gh workflow run atomaton-deploy.yml --ref main -f target=release
```

## Applying a release to this repository

A release does not change how this repository's own agents run. `.github/` has to
be rebuilt from it, which is a second, deliberate step.

```bash
gh workflow run atomaton-self-deploy.yml --ref main -f version=latest
```

Or press **Run workflow** on **Atomaton Self Deploy** in the Actions tab. It opens a
pull request and merges nothing: `.github/**` is in `merge.governed_paths`, so a person
reviews it.

What the job does, in three lines:

```bash
rm -rf .github            # a file the release DELETED is gone, not orphaned
unzip atomaton-delivery.zip  # the deliverable
cp -r self/. .github/     # this repository's own, at the same paths
```

The `rm -rf` is the point. `unzip -o` overwrites and never removes, so before
`self/` existed a file the template had dropped stayed in the tree with no diff to
notice it by — the old procedure told you to go looking for orphans yourself.
Deleting first makes an upstream removal ordinary.

### The token, and why it is a PAT

`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot write `.github/workflows/**`. Not by path rule and not by
branch: the push is refused on **identity**, measured here. This deploy replaces
those files, so no arrangement of paths avoids it.

So the workflow needs `ATOMA_SELF_DEPLOY_TOKEN` — a fine-grained or classic PAT
with the `workflow` scope, set as an Actions secret in this repository:

```bash
gh secret set ATOMA_SELF_DEPLOY_TOKEN
```

**No agent can reach it.** It is named in `self/workflows/atomaton-self-deploy.yml`
and nowhere else; `atomaton-runner.yml` does not mention it, and `atoma` hands a tool
server only the credentials that server's own `env` declares. The workflow also
refuses a bot as `triggering_actor`, because the agent runner's token carries
`actions: write` and could therefore dispatch a workflow in principle —
an agent has no route to it today (`gh` and `curl` are both refused by the shell
guard, and no MCP tool dispatches anything), but that is a denylist, and this token
can rewrite workflows.

A PAT is acceptable here and not inside Atomaton because what holds it is a person
pressing a button. The line in #353 — a pull request may not decide its own
execution environment — is not crossed: nothing an agent produces reaches it.

### Changing something in `self/`

An overlay entry is a copy, not a build, so it needs no release. Change `self/X`
and `.github/X` in the **same pull request**, identically.

`tests/contract/self-overlay.test.ts` requires them byte-identical, in both
directions, which is what stops a change from being half-applied.

Editing `.github/X` alone is worse than not editing it: the next self-deploy
overwrites it from `self/` and the change disappears without a diff.

Nothing checks that every file in `.github/` is accounted for, and nothing needs
to. The deploy runs `rm -rf .github` first, so a file the release stopped shipping
is not recreated. A file ADDED to `.github/` with no counterpart in `self/` would
be silently removed by the next deploy — but `.github/**` is in `merge.governed_paths`,
so any pull request touching it carries the blocker "this pull request changes how
agents themselves run" and no agent can merge it. A person is already reading it.

## Setup (Bun)

```bash
bun install
```

Required engine in this repository is Bun `>=1.2.0`.

## Validation commands

```bash
bun run typecheck
bun run synth
bun run test
bun run test:e2e
```

What each command proves:

- `typecheck`: static type contract for scripts/workflows/shared libs.
- `synth`: workflow generation and deliverable build to `dist/.github`.
- `test`: unit-level behavior across `src/domain`, `src/lib`, `src/scripts`, and MCP/hook scripts.
- `test:e2e`: end-to-end checks in `tests/e2e`.

`test:e2e` runs against the built tree, so `bun run synth` has to come first — it
reads `dist/.github/atomaton-runtime/tools/mcp/*.ts`, which an untracked `dist/` does
not have until you build it.

## Generated-file discipline

- **`dist/` is gitignored.** There is nothing generated to commit, and nothing to
  keep in sync with `src/`. Change `src/*` and let a release build it.
- Run `bun run synth` locally whenever you want to inspect what adopters will
  receive. CI runs it on every pull request, before `test`, to prove the
  deliverable still builds.
- `dist/.github/*` is generated: never hand-edit it.
- `.github/*` is *deployed*, not generated on merge. It is a release plus `self/`
  copied over it, rebuilt by [Atomaton Self Deploy](#applying-a-release-to-this-repository).
  So a change under `src/` does not reach the live agents until someone
  dispatches that, and CI does not reject a diff that touches `.github/`.
- What is genuinely yours to edit lives in `self/`, not in `.github/`. Edit both,
  identically, in one pull request — `tests/contract/self-overlay.test.ts` requires
  it. Editing `.github/` alone is worse than not editing it: the next self-deploy
  reverts it, silently.

## PR checklist

- Describe behavior changes from an adopter perspective.
- Include exact commands you ran and outcomes.
- Do not include `.github/atomaton`; it is upgraded deliberately, not per pull
  request. `dist/` cannot appear at all — it is gitignored.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.
- If you changed workflow dispatch semantics, call out backward compatibility impact explicitly.
