# probe-shared-worktree.sh — can two OS users share the work tree?
#
# The confinement design runs the shell tool server under a different uid, which the
# dumpable probe showed closes the environ hole outright. This asks the question
# that decides whether that is implementable at all: **the agent edits files**, so
# the shell user has to write the checkout `runner` owns, and `runner`'s git has to
# commit what the shell user wrote.
#
# The container answered this with `--user 1234:0` -- group 0, so the container
# wrote a tree the host owned. Same problem, without the container.
#
# The part that is easy to get wrong is not permission to CREATE a file. It is
# permission to MODIFY one the other user created: with a default umask a new file
# is `rw-r--r--` owned by its creator, so the other user can delete and replace it
# but cannot edit it in place -- and `filesystem__edit_file` edits in place. Two
# tools would see one file and only one could write it, which is worse than the
# split this exists to remove.
#
# Three mechanisms, weakest first, each on a FRESH tree so the previous round's
# arrangement cannot carry it:
#
#   1. nothing but a shared group                    -- the baseline
#   2. shared group + umask 002 + setgid directory   -- the classic arrangement
#   3. a default POSIX ACL                           -- independent of umask
#
# Why 3 matters even if 2 works: a shell command can call `umask` itself, and an
# arrangement a command inside the sandbox can undo is not an arrangement. Round 3
# is therefore run with umask 022 on purpose.
#
# Every answer prints as `RESULT <name>=<value>`. Nothing here tests Atoma.

# ── 6. the arrangement as it would actually be deployed ──────────────────────

# Rounds 1-5 all ran with the shell user in the runner's GROUP, and with the tree
# in /tmp. Both were wrong, and each hid something.
#
# **The group would have opened the hole this is closing.** The runner's HOME is
# 750 with group `runner`, so a shell user in that group can read everything
# group-readable inside it -- including `~/.bun/bin`, which is on the
# credential-holding servers' PATH and is where a fake `gh` was measured being
# planted. Section 5's `shell_user_runs_bun_from_home=yes` came from the group,
# not from anything safe.
#
# **And /tmp is world-traversable, which the real work tree is not.** A checkout
# lives under `/home/runner/work/...`, so a user outside the group cannot even
# reach it -- ACL on the tree or not. The ACL therefore has to grant traversal on
# the path down to it, and `x` without `r` is exactly what an ACL can express and
# a mode cannot: reach the workspace, without being able to list HOME.
#
# So this round is the deployment: no shared group, the tree where a checkout
# really is, and traversal granted per-user.

*_runner_edits_shell_file=no   -> that mechanism is NOT sufficient: both tools would
                                  see the file and only one could write it.
group_umask_defeated_*=no      -> umask 002 is not an arrangement, it is a request.
                                  A shell command can call `umask` and undo it.
acl_*=yes                      -> a default ACL carries it regardless of umask.
git_commit=yes                 -> runner can commit what the shell user wrote, so
                                  the deliverable path is unaffected.
shell_user_runs_bun_from_home  -> whether the design may depend on $HOME's mode.
isolated_reaches_tree_after=yes and
isolated_lists_home=no         -> the deployment works: reach the workspace without
                                  being able to see the home directory it is under.
group_user_plants_fake_gh      -> whether the group would have opened the hole this
                                  is closing. `no` means ~/.bun/bin is not
                                  group-writable on this image, and the threat the
                                  recorded was the shell running AS runner.
home_file_*=readable_by_isolated=yes for anything holding a credential
                               -> traversal on HOME is too wide and has to be
                                  narrowed to the work path alone.
*_from_usr_bin=yes and
*_writes_bun_in_usr_bin=no     -> the alternative works and cannot be tampered with,
                                  so $HOME's mode stops mattering.
