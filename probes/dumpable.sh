# probe-dumpable.sh — the measurement the confinement design turns on.
#
# Three questions, in the order they decide things:
#
#   1. Does `PR_SET_DUMPABLE(0)` survive `execve` into an ordinary binary?
#      If it does, every MCP server atoma spawns is already non-dumpable, and the
#      premise the container was built on -- "a same-user process can read the
#      environ of the servers that hold credentials" -- does not hold.
#
#   2. With the flag NOT set, can a same-user process read another's environ?
#      The baseline `process_protection.rs` measured. Re-asked so the answer to 1
#      is read against a control on the same runner, not a table from another one.
#
#   3. Can a DIFFERENT uid read it either way?
#      The mechanism proposed instead.
#
# And a fourth, because a uid does not close it: is a world-writable directory
# really on PATH, where a fake `gh` would be found before the real one.
#
# Nothing here tests Atoma. These are properties of the kernel and the runner
# image, so they are asked directly -- no atoma binary, no model call, no tool
# servers. Every answer prints as `RESULT <name>=<value>`.
#
# ## Two corrections from the first version, both worth keeping written down
#
# It read dumpability from `/proc/self/status`. **There is no `Dumpable` field
# there.** The parse raised, the holder died before it could report, and the
# question this probe exists for came back `unknown` while three other answers
# looked fine. `prctl(PR_GET_DUMPABLE)` is the way to read it.
#
# It also tested PATH entries with `stat -c '%A'`, which does not follow symlinks
# -- so every symlink reported `lrwxrwxrwx` and counted as world-writable. `/bin`
# and `/sbin` are symlinks on this image, and both were false positives.

after_exec_dumpable=0  -> the flag survives execve. Every server atoma spawns is
                          already non-dumpable, and the environ premise does
                          not hold, so the fix is a PATH change plus a uid.
after_exec_dumpable=1  -> it does not survive. The servers holding credentials
                          are readable by a same-uid process, and a different uid
                          is what closes it.
