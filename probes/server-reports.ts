/**
 * probe-server-reports.ts — does a report actually reach the wire?
 *
 * This repository's servers moved off "write WARN to stderr and hope atoma's
 * word-matching catches it" and onto MCP's `notifications/message`, where the level
 * is a field. Everything about that is checkable by reading the source except the
 * part that matters: that a server, started as a real process, puts the
 * notification on the wire — and that a report raised *before* it had anywhere to
 * send it still arrives.
 *
 * That second half is what earns a probe. A reranker fails while loading and
 * `harden.ts` speaks at module scope, both long before any tool is called, so a
 * report that could only travel through an open connection would be the one report
 * that never arrives.
 *
 * ## Two halves, and what each is worth
 *
 * **1. `mcp/github.ts`, the real thing.** Asked only what a real server can be asked
 * without breaking it on purpose: does it declare the `logging` capability, and does
 * it answer `logging/setLevel`. That capability is the silent one — the SDK's
 * `sendLoggingMessage` returns without sending when it is missing, so undeclaring it
 * stops every report while nothing anywhere fails.
 *
 * **2. a server built out of the same parts.** `--serve` makes this file a server
 * that uses the real `serveMcpServer` and the real `report`, and raises a report at
 * module scope. Only the message is invented; the machinery under it is what every
 * shipped server runs.
 *
 * The honest limit: this does not prove that `search.ts` reports when its reranker
 * fails. Forcing that needs the 544MB model and an unwritable cache, and forcing
 * `harden.ts`'s PATH refusal turned out to be unreachable from outside — `bun run`
 * puts its own directories on PATH, so the "every entry is unsafe" case cannot be
 * arranged. What holds those call sites is `tests/contract/server-reports.test.ts`,
 * which checks that the texts exist and are not on `log()`.
 *
 * atoma's half — reading the notification and attaching it to the next tool result —
 * is measured in probe-tool-health.ts against the released binary. This is the other
 * end of the same wire.
 *
 * Not part of the deliverable -- this repository's own CI, like probe-dumpable.sh.
