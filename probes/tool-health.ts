/**
 * probe-tool-health.ts — does a server's report about itself actually reach the
 * model?
 *
 * atoma v0.1.18 attaches what a tool server said about its own trouble
 * to that server's next tool result, and the prompt instructs an agent to act on it. Both
 * are built on a claim that had never been run: that the note survives the whole
 * path from a server's stderr line, or its `notifications/message`, into the
 * request the model receives.
 *
 * Nothing in either repository's test suite covers that path. atoma's tests reach
 * the pure functions and a mock tool port; this repository's reach the wording.
 * Between them sits a protocol handshake, a spawned reader task and a request body
 * -- and the failure mode of this feature is silence, which is exactly what a
 * healthy run looks like. So it is measured rather than reasoned about.
 *
 * ## What this stands up
 *
 *   a fake MCP server   -- warns on BOTH channels, so one run tests both
 *   a fake LLM          -- calls the tool once, then records what it was sent
 *   the real atoma       -- the released binary, not a build of main
 *
 * The fake LLM is the assertion point, and it has to be: the annotation's whole
 * purpose is to be in front of the model, and the only place that is observable is
 * the request body. Reading atoma's own log would prove the note was made, not
 * that it arrived.
 *
 * Run with `--mcp` and this file IS the fake server, which is how the server's
 * source stays next to the expectations about it.
 *
 * Not part of the deliverable -- this repository's own CI, like probe-dumpable.sh.

/**
 * A stdio MCP server that declares `logging`, reports on both channels, and
 * answers one tool.
 *
 * The stderr line goes out at startup on purpose: that is the case the whole
 * feature exists for (a reranker failed while the server was starting, long
 * before any search arrived), and it is the one with a race in it -- atoma spawns
 * the stderr reader after `initialize` returns, so whether the line is read before
 * the first tool result is a matter of scheduling. Measuring it is the point.
