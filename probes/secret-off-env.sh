# probe-secret-off-env.sh — can a credential be held where a same-user process
# cannot reach it?
#
# This started as "isolate the shell with a uid". That closes the hole but leaves
# `$HOME` meaning two things, which is the confusion it was meant to remove. The
# alternative is to stop protecting the process and protect the VALUE: if the
# credential is not in an environment block and the holder's memory is unreadable,
# then a same-user shell has nothing to take and needs no isolation at all --
# same user, same HOME, no container, no ACL, no divergence.
#
# core's own `process_protection.rs` already argues for it: "Not a substitute for
# keeping credentials out of environment blocks in the first place... Only never
# putting it there works."
#
# Three questions, and the design stands or falls on the first:
#
#   1. Can a Bun process make ITSELF non-dumpable? `PR_SET_DUMPABLE(0)` does not
#      survive `execve` -- measured -- so atoma cannot do it on a server's behalf.
#      The server has to call `prctl`, and Bun reaches libc through `bun:ffi`.
#
#   2. With the credential off the environment, is it absent from `environ`?
#
#   3. Non-dumpable, is `/proc/<pid>/mem` refused to the same user? core's table
#      says yes; re-asked here because the whole design rests on it and because
#      that table also says the unprotected case depends on the host's
#      `ptrace_scope`, which nobody here controls.
#
# Every answer prints as `RESULT <name>=<value>`.

hardened_ffi_called=true and
hardened_dumpable_after=0   -> a Bun server CAN make itself unreadable, which is what
                               the whole alternative rests on. atoma cannot do it for
                               the server: the flag does not survive execve.
stdin_environ=absent        -> taking the value off the environment removes it from
                               the one place a same-user process can always read.
hardened_memory=refused-*   -> and the heap is closed too, without depending on the
                               host's ptrace_scope.

All three -> the shell needs no isolation at all: same user, same HOME, no container,
             no ACL, and nothing for it to take.
Any one failing -> back to isolating the process, and $HOME keeps meaning two things.
