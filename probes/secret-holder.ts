/**
 * probe-secret-holder.ts — stands in for a credential-holding MCP server.
 *
 * Three ways a server can hold a credential, so a reader can be pointed at each:
 *
 *   env      the value is in this process's environment block -- how tools.yaml
 *            routes credentials today
 *   stdin    the value arrives on stdin and lives only in the heap
 *   stdin+nd the same, and the process makes itself non-dumpable first
 *   env+nd   the value stays in the environment AND the process makes itself
 *            non-dumpable -- the arrangement that needs no change to how atoma
 *            delivers credentials, and the one the design now rests on
 *
 * The last one is the unknown the confinement design turns on. `PR_SET_DUMPABLE(0)` is what
 * makes `/proc/<pid>/environ` and `/proc/<pid>/mem` unreadable to the same user,
 * atoma calls it for itself, and it does NOT survive `execve` -- so a server has
 * to call it in its own process. Whether Bun can is the question: it needs
 * `prctl`, and Bun reaches libc through `bun:ffi`.
 *
 * Nothing about Atoma is tested here. Run as:
 *   echo "<secret>" | bun run probe-secret-holder.ts <env|stdin|stdin+nd> <pidfile>
