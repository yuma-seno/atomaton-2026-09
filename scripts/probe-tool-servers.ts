/**
 * probe-tool-servers.ts — do the tool servers actually start, at the layout a run
 * uses?
 *
 * `atomaton-check` is scan_secrets → typecheck → synth → test, and **not one of those
 * starts a tool server as a process.** Four defects of one shape landed in a
 * single day, all green in CI, all found only after deploying: the worst was a path
 * where moving the machinery out of the work tree put `node_modules` out of reach
 * of the module-resolution walk and the search server could not start at all.
 * Atoma treats a server that will not initialise as fatal, so one unresolvable
 * import took every run down.
 *
 * Nothing in CI would say so, because nothing in CI ran a server.
 *
 * ## What this asks, and what it costs
 *
 * One turn of a run: every server in `tools.yaml` spawns, answers `initialize`,
 * and registers its tools. Then the fake LLM says stop. No provider is called and
 * no tool is called -- the question is whether the servers come up, and the answer
 * to that is the tool list.
 *
 * The tool list is read from the request the model receives, which is where a
 * server that came up but registered nothing becomes visible. Reading atoma's log
 * would show a connection; only the request shows what the agent was given.
 *
 * ## The layout is the point
 *
 * Running the servers from the work tree would prove nothing about that path defect:
 * defect is entirely about WHERE the files are. So this reproduces the two facts
 * the runner's install step establishes --
 *
 *   - the machinery lives at `${RUNNER_TEMP}/atomaton-machinery`, out of the work tree
 *   - the libraries a server imports live at `${RUNNER_TEMP}/node_modules`, beside
 *     it rather than in the project's own tree
 *
 * -- and `assertLayoutStillMatches` fails if `atomaton-runner.wac.ts` stops saying
 * either. A probe that quietly tested a layout the runner no longer uses would be
 * worse than no probe, which is the argument against fake servers.
 *
 * ## What it does not catch
 *
 * the reranker's cache turning read-only. The load is deliberately started in
 * the background and not awaited, so a run initialises fine and the failure
 * is 60 seconds away. Any warning a server does manage to emit in that window is
 * printed here, but nothing waits for one. That case is now covered at run time
 * instead -- atoma v0.1.18 hands the warning to the agent.
 *
 * Not part of the deliverable -- this repository's own CI, like probe-dumpable.sh.
