# The deployment this project declares in `deploy.atoma_runs.targets`. Everything a release
# does is here, in a file an agent can write, rather than in a workflow file it
# cannot — which is the whole reason the pipeline moved into configuration.
#
# The version is not passed in. `package.json`'s `version` is the single
# declaration and the tag is derived from it, so the two cannot disagree and
# there is no separate tagging step to remember. Releasing is therefore an
# ordinary reviewed change: bump the version, and merging it publishes.
#
# Idempotent, and that is what makes `on: merge` safe. This runs after every
# merge, finds a release already exists for the declared version, and stops
# before installing anything. Only a merge that changes the version reaches the
# build.
