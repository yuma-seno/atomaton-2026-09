# probe-tool-user.sh — the arrangement the confinement design lands on, run end to end before it is
# written into the runner.
#
# The decision: every tool server runs as one dedicated OS user that is not in
# sudoers. Same user for all of them, so no tool sees a different environment from
# another -- which is the property the container could not give. `$HOME` points at
# the runner's home so the toolchain resolves, readable and not writable, the same
# for every tool.
#
# What is protected, and what is not, is a decision rather than a mechanism: the
# three properties "one environment", "secrets hidden from the shell" and
# "arbitrary third-party servers" cannot hold together, and the guarantee for the
# third is what was given up.
#
# Everything here is a mechanic the runner will depend on. Each one has cost a
# round trip before, in this repository's history, so each is asked directly:
#
#   1. the user can be created, and has no sudo
#   2. it can reach and write the workspace, and the runner can edit back
#   3. it can execute bun, which lives in the runner's HOME
#   4. HOME is readable and NOT writable, and a redirected cache is writable
#   5. `sudo -u` passes an environment through in a form that works
#   6. git, as the runner, still handles what that user wrote
