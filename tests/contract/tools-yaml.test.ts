 *
 * Three tests already touch the file and all three use regular expressions: one
 * counts `command:` lines, one greps for a machinery prefix, one checks a hook
 * path. A malformed flow sequence would satisfy every one of them and then fail
 * at run time, where the symptom is that no agent can start at all — and this
 * repository has no way to run atoma before CI, so the first execution IS
 * production.
 *
 * The `shell` entry is what made this worth writing. Its `args` was a
 * twenty-line flow sequence for a container invocation, hand-written; the rework reduced
 * it to a plain `bun run`, and the test that pinned the container is now the test
 * that keeps one from coming back.
