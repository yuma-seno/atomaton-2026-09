 * `ATOMA_DEPLOY_*` inputs that select what a run deploys, and `TOOL_SECRETS` was
 * missing `ATOMA_COPILOT_TOKEN`, so a project could name it in `tools.secrets`
 * and overwrite the credential its own run authenticates with.
 *
 * These tests read the generated YAML, so the next name added to a carrier step
 * fails here rather than becoming a shadowing hole nobody notices.
