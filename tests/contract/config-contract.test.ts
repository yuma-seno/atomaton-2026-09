/**
 * config.json's recognised keys, in the type and at run time.
 *
 * `AtomaConfig` in `lib/types.ts` is the definition and `CONFIG_SCHEMA` in
 * `domain/deliverable-integrity.ts` is the runtime mirror, because an interface is
 * erased before anything can consult it. Two lists of the same fact — which is
 * exactly what `validate_deliverable.ts` exists to catch in an adopter's config, so
 * it had better not be uncheckable here.
 *
 * The interface is the authority, and this reads it with TypeScript's own parser
 * rather than with a regular expression. A regex was tried and is not good enough:
 * the nested members are indented inconsistently in that file (one is at five
 * spaces), `Record<string, {...}>` has to be understood rather than matched, and an
 * index signature means something specific — any name is legal here — that a line
 * pattern cannot distinguish from a property.
 *
 * Drift in either direction is a real failure. A key added to the type and not to
 * the schema is reported to an adopter as a typo, for a setting the code reads. One
 * added to the schema and not the type is accepted and read by nothing.
