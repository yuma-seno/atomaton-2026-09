/**
 * server-reports.test.ts — the servers this repository ships report over the
 * protocol, and their log lines do not pretend to.
 *
 * atoma has two channels for a server's trouble. `notifications/message`
 * carries a level the server chose; a spawned server's stderr is the fallback, and
 * severity there is read out of the words — `warn`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal`,
 * `panic`. That guess fails in both directions, and this is about not relying on it
 * for the servers we own.
 *
 * Which leaves one thing a test can hold: **a log line in a shipped server must not
 * contain a severity word.** If it does, one of two things is true and both are
 * wrong —
 *
 *   - it is a report, and it should go through `lib/mcp-report.ts`
 *   - it is not, and the fallback will put it in front of an agent as a problem
 *
 * The scope is `src/atomaton-runtime/tools/**`, which is code that only ever runs as a
 * tool server. `src/lib/**` is deliberately outside it: those functions are called
 * from workflow scripts too, where there is no protocol channel and a WARN on
 * stderr is what a person reads in the run log. Their lines still reach the
 * fallback when a server calls them, which is the behaviour that already existed.
 *
 * Only literal text is checked. A message that interpolates an error can always
 * contain the word "error", and nothing here can prevent that.
