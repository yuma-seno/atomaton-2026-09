/**
 * `self/` and `.github/` do not drift apart.
 *
 * ## What this replaced
 *
 * `.github/` used to be the release archive extracted over the previous contents,
 * with three files kept alive by remembering to run `git checkout --` on them
 * afterwards. Two things went wrong with that, and both were silent:
 *
 * - a file the upstream release had **deleted** stayed in the tree. `unzip -o`
 *   overwrites and never removes, so there was no diff to notice it by. The old
 *   `conventions.md` said to "look for orphans under `.github/atoma/` yourself".
 * - the preserve list lived in a person's memory. `config.yaml` was restored every
 *   time because it was remembered, not because anything checked.
 *
 * `self/` mirrors `.github/`, so the deploy became `rm -rf .github`, extract, copy
 * `self/` over it. An upstream removal is now ordinary -- the file is not recreated
 * -- and the preserve list is a directory rather than a habit.
 *
 * ## What these tests hold
 *
 * That the two copies of every overlay file agree, in both directions: the file
 * exists in both places, and holds the same bytes.
 *
 * An overlay entry needs no release to take effect -- it is a copy, not a build --
 * so a change to `self/X` belongs in the same pull request as the identical change
 * to `.github/X`. This is what turns "remember to change both" into a failing
 * check, and it is why an agent improving `config.yaml` cannot half-apply it.
 *
 * ## Why there is no "every file in `.github/` is accounted for" test
 *
 * There was one, and it was wrong. It required every file under `.github/` to
 * exist in `dist/.github/` or `self/`, meaning to catch a file that accumulated.
 *
 * Nothing accumulates any more. The deploy runs `rm -rf .github` first, so a file
 * the release stopped shipping is simply not recreated -- which is the whole reason
 * `self/` exists. There is nothing left for that test to find.
 *
 * Worse, it was a false alarm waiting to happen. `dist/` is built from the CURRENT
 * `src/`, while `.github/` holds an older release, and the lag between them is
 * deliberate: a change to `src/` must not reconfigure the live agents the moment it
 * merges, and two breakages reached the running system exactly that way. So merge a
 * change that DELETES a file from `src/`, then deploy a release that predates it,
 * and the test fails on a correct deploy pull request.
 *
 * The one case it did cover on its own -- a file added to `.github/` with no
 * counterpart in `self/`, which the next deploy would silently remove -- is already
 * in front of a person. `.github/**` is in `merge.governed_paths`, so any pull request
 * touching it carries the blocker "this pull request changes how agents themselves
 * run" and cannot be merged by an agent at all.
 *
 * These tests likewise do not check that `.github/` matches the current `src/`, for
 * the same reason: the lag is the design, not a defect to detect.
