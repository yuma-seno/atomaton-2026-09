/**
 * `examples/` is for the adopter to copy, and must never become deliverable.
 *
 * The whole point of the recurring-work example is that Atomaton does not install
 * it: `on:` takes no expression, so a schedule cannot come from configuration,
 * and an agent cannot write `.github/workflows/**` at all. If one of these files
 * ever reached `dist/.github/workflows/`, every adopter would start running a
 * schedule nobody asked for -- and the one whose cron fires an agent run would
 * be paying for it.
 *
 * Nothing in `build-dist.ts` or `wac.config.ts` looks at `examples/` today. This
 * is here so that stays true, since the failure is silent and arrives by upgrade.
