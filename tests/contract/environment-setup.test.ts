/**
 * Every job that runs a project's own commands sets that project's environment up
 * first.
 *
 * The failure this prevents is not a broken build. It is a build that passes for
 * the agent and fails in CI, on a machine the agent cannot see, which comes back
 * to an engineer as a defect that does not reproduce -- and `CI_RETRY_LIMIT`
 * spends three inferences on it before a human hears about it.
 *
 * Pinned against the generated YAML rather than the `.wac.ts`, because the
 * generated file is what an adopter receives and what actually runs. A fourth job
 * that runs project commands should fail this test until it includes the step.
